"Immantique is a place of exhibition, diffusion, production, experimentation in favour of contemporary creation, resulting in various fields of contemporary art. Immanence is a very primitive place for contemporary artists. Immanence promotes the diversity and diversity of the media (painting, video, digital art, dance, performance, installations, design, architecture...) offering to the public a wide range of proposals and creation. Immanence is a space of contemporary art in the service of contemporary artists. Immanence is also associated with the diversity and diversity of contemporary artists. The 21st Avenue of Maine is one of the high places of artistic creation in Paris. Today it is preserved from the real estate speculation, and property of the city of Paris, it is a monumental place, one of the islands of Montparnasse's artistic life, composed of a set of workshops built from the beginning of the century into a small fortress where buildings in brick and glass are buried under the vineyard. Named by its occupations, alley, impregnated or street, the 21st Avenue of Maine was sometimes the chassis of the Maine. Property in 1861 of the Goufier and Bauban women, it was a line of post where the 19th century was changed to the King's. Immania was created in 1998 at a time when many artists appeared. These exhibition sites were also a response to a particular situation. The context of the period is: The financial crisis in France will see the expansion of the market of art, starting in the first years of this century. The artists are no longer able to expose themselves in the galleries after the others. They will create their own structures of art. They are more complex and the financial crisis is not only false, they are added to the generation crisis in the world of art. There are times when the artistic work of an artist is related to one or more exhibitions. Sometimes the artistic practice is removed from the curator's practice. Whatever is, this dual practice of a curator is said to be completely occupied and lived. In the fundamental artists of the place, the artistic activity is parallel to the management of an exhibition. These artists show an alternative mode of operation of a line.

"West Space Projects are programmed to run alongside our application-based program and provide support to artist-initiated/ developed exhibitions, publications, sound releases, performances, international exchanges and forums. These ambitious projects negotiate innovative approaches to cultural debate, production, presentation, collaboration and exchange. They extend across artforms and into non-arts areas. The West Space Projects Program enables West Space to actively generate, contribute to and support quality cultural development, alongside performing the more usual artist-run-space role of presenting an application-based exhibition program. West Space was established in 1993 in Footscray by Brett Jones and Sarah Stubbs and was, at the time, one of the few artist-run initiatives to present a critically engaged, multi-art form program accessible to practitioners through peer-assessed applications. The organisation quickly grew in stature and reputation, moving premises in 2000 with the assistance of the City of Melbourne to a location in Anthony Street, between RMIT University and the Queen Victoria Market. In 2011 West Space began an exciting new chapter, moving to our much larger and centrally located current site, at Level 1 of the City of Melbourne owned building City Village at 225 Bourke Street. This substantially greater size has enabled us to radically expand our artistic program, offering more opportunities for audiences to engage with innovative arts events in the heart of Melbourne. West Space has developed a significant reputation amongst Australian and international arts organisations. This has been forged through a sustained belief in the importance of artist-run culture to practitioners, audiences and the art industry, and has manifested in a critically renowned exhibition program and a prolific range of self-generated projects and publications. Over the past 22 years West Space has exhibited over 2500 individual artists, produced 45 publications and a journal comprising 13 issues, and developed over 60 projects, including 10 international projects in Singapore, Milan, Vancouver, Toronto, Osaka, Seoul, Glasgow, Hong Kong, Oyama and Paris.",west space projects programmed alongside application based program provide support artist initiated developed exhibitions publications sound releases performances international exchanges forums ambitious projects negotiate innovative approaches cultural debate production presentation collaboration exchange extend artforms non arts areas west space projects program enables west space actively generate contribute support quality cultural development alongside performing usual artist space role presenting application based exhibition program west space established footscray brett jones sarah stubbs artist initiatives present critically engaged multi art form program accessible practitioners peer assessed applications organisation quickly grew stature reputation moving premises assistance city melbourne location anthony street rmit university queen victoria market west space began exciting chapter moving larger centrally current level city melbourne owned building city village bourke street substantially greater size enabled radically expand artistic program offering opportunities audiences engage innovative arts events heart melbourne west space developed significant reputation australian international arts organisations forged sustained belief importance artist culture practitioners audiences art industry manifested critically renowned exhibition program prolific range self generated projects publications past years west space exhibited individual artists produced publications journal comprising issues developed projects including international projects singapore milan vancouver toronto osaka seoul glasgow hong kong oyama paris

"Throughout its history, Para Site's activities have included a range of different formats, among which a smaller parallel exhibition space, Para/Site Central, hosted by Hanart TZ Gallery in Central (1997-2008); P/S magazine (1997-2006), a bilingual publication which was Hong Kong's first visual arts magazine and a central platform for the development of art writing and of a discursive scene in the city; and the Curatorial Training Programme (2007-2010). Since 2012, Para Site has been running an International Art Residency Programme. Para Site is Hong Kong's leading contemporary art centre and one of the oldest and most active independent art institutions in Asia. It produces exhibitions, publications and discursive projects aimed at forging a critical understanding of local and international phenomena in art and society. Founded in early 1996 as an artist run space, Para Site was Hong Kong's first institution of contemporary art and a crucial self-organised structure within the city’s civil society, during the uncertain period preceding its handover to Mainland China. Throughout the years, Para Site has evolved into a professional contemporary art centre, engaged in a wide array of activities and collaborations with other art institutions, museums, biennials and academic structures in Hong Kong and the international landscape. After the first year in Kennedy Town, Para Site relocated to Po Yan Street in Sheung Wan (at no. 2 in the initial years and at no. 4 until 2014). Para Site moved to North Point/Quarry Bay in early 2015.

"Since September 1995, we have proposed a young artist's programming: this action is intended to form a flexible complement to the professional environment of art (Gallerys, Institutions). Our ""associative gallery apartment"" has been called a place of exchange and meeting. Since September 1996, the programming has integrated artists such as Marc-Camille Chaimowicz, Jean Dupuy, Ming, Pat Bruder, Didier Marcel, Philippe Cazal, Marc Cutturier, Jean Dupuy, Niek van Steeg... .Claude Rutault.

"Spazio In Situ opened the 27th October 2017 presenting the exhibition What if?, that shows a work from each artist of the group. In Situ was spountaneously born by working togheter as a group, free from the critical-historical meaninig of the term “artistic group”, with the purpose of facing the complex role that artists have in our contemporary society, and in order to reach a higher level of artistic research. In Situ is more than a set of studios, it’s a studio devoted to the constant research of ideas, a place where personal growth meets the collective growth, an open-space without any walls between each artist studio. Artworks are free to live in the space, breathing an open-minded atmosphere that leads to a huge network of hyperlinks and unlimited possibilities. In Situ constanly challenge himself re-thinking the space and its role, an example is the exhibition project Contemporary Absurdity, a six solo exhibitions cycle with works by Marco De Rosa, Roberta Folliero, Andrea Frosolini, Christophe Constantin, Francesco Palluzzi, Elisa Selli. The space during the exhibitions turns into a White Cube, one time sacral space for every artwork that is inside, and now creating an ecosystem in which common objects become icons of a concpt, shifting the viewer from reality to illusion.Text by Sara Fiorelli The 27th October 2018, Spazio In Situ celebrates two years togheter with the exhibition OUT OF SPACE, giving birth to Spazio In Più and welcoming other five artist studios (Sveva Angeletti, Federica Di Pietrantonio, Chiara Fantaccione, Daniele Sciacca, Guendalina Urbani).",spazio situ opened 27th october presenting exhibition shows work artist group situ spountaneously born working togheter group free critical historical meaninig term artistic group purpose facing complex role artists contemporary society order reach higher level artistic research situ set studios studio devoted constant research ideas personal growth meets collective growth space walls artist studio artworks free live space breathing minded atmosphere leads huge network hyperlinks unlimited possibilities situ constanly challenge thinking space role example exhibition project contemporary absurdity solo exhibitions cycle works marco rosa roberta folliero andrea frosolini christophe constantin francesco palluzzi elisa selli space exhibitions turns cube sacral space artwork inside creating ecosystem common objects icons concpt shifting viewer reality illusion text sara fiorelli 27th october spazio situ celebrates years togheter exhibition space giving birth spazio più welcoming artist studios sveva angeletti federica pietrantonio chiara fantaccione daniele sciacca guendalina urbani

"Gallery 44 is centered on three programming areas: We offer affordable production facilities to over 400 artist members, including darkrooms and digital printing, ensuring that artists working across diverse media have an accessible space to experiment and develop their photo-based practices.Providing a similarly accessible gallery space, G44 presents dynamic exhibitions that reflect a range of contemporary issues and visual forms. As a mentor-focused institution, rather than a curator-focused one, we maintain a collaborative approach in which artists play a central and active role in shaping programming and supporting one another’s artistic development. G44 dedicates significant portions of our programming calendar each year to focusing on emerging artists. Longstanding programs, such as Proof and Cameralinks, provide a place for artists at the cusp of their own explorations into seeing to widen the dialogue around contemporary photography.An equally important part of our mandate is to provide production, exhibition, mentorship and scholarship opportunities to youth throughout the GTA. Gallery 44’s OUTREACH program, for example, offers photography workshops to youth from underserved communities. This unique program inspires youth to develop positive methods of sharing their stories and to initiate critical explorations into art-viewing and art-making. As one of the only artist-run centres in Canada providing ongoing, hands-on arts education to youth, our award-winning education programs encourage greater visual literacy, while fostering a new generation of artists. Gallery 44 Centre for Contemporary Photography is a charitable, non-profit, artist-run centre committed to supporting multi-faceted approaches to photography and lens-based media. Founded in 1979 to establish a supportive environment for the development of artistic practice, Gallery 44’s mandate is to provide a context for meaningful reflection and dialogue on contemporary photography. Gallery 44 is committed to programs that reflect the continuously changing definition of photography by presenting a wide range of practices that engage timely and critical explorations of the medium. Through exhibitions, public engagement, education programs and production facilities our objective is to explore the artistic, cultural, historic, social and political implications of the image in our ever-expanding visual world. Gallery 44 was founded in 1979 by a small group of artists in need of production facilities who joined together to share darkroom and studio space. Forming a collective was an important first step in making facilities affordable and in creating a supportive community of artists with common goals. In 1980, the collective began mounting exhibitions and in 1981 began offering photography workshops. Gallery 44 moved from its original location on Niagara Street to Bathurst Street in 1986, where both the production and exhibition facilities were expanded to serve a growing membership. Due to a severe lack of photographic education in elementary and secondary schools, Gallery 44 began its Education in the Schools program in 1987. In 1994, Gallery 44 moved to 401 Richmond St. W. to improve the centre's exhibition and production facilities and to widen its audience through a more centralized location. The main floor of our space currently includes the administrative office, main gallery and adjacent vitrines gallery that host our seven annual exhibitions and our Members’ Gallery, which exclusively showcases the work of our members. Gallery 44’s 2,673 square foot, accessible facilities are located in the basement of 401 and include darkrooms, a shooting studio, scanning lab, wide format digital printing, print finishing area, resource library, and the Production Gallery which highlights works produced in our facilities. Throughout its history Gallery 44 has prioritized equitable access by breaking down barriers to the arts for artists, audiences and youth. We do so by programming outside of the downtown core, collaborating with numerous community partners both within and outside of our sector, supporting artistic experimentation and risk-taking and providing accessible public programs and production support to emerging practitioners, diverse artists and young people from across the GTA. Gallery 44’s partners include: ImagineNATIVE, Images Festival, Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival, Toronto District School Board, OCAD University, Trinity Square Video, NIA Centre for the Arts, Tangled Art + Disability and many more. While Gallery 44 continues to develop and evolve we have remained committed to our history as an artist-run centre, which in part relates to fostering collaborative decision-making and the sharing of leadership roles. Retaining the spirit of an artist-run centre, members, Board and staff work together to develop and implement programs that highlight unique artistic practices, engage a wide audience and increase the access to and understanding of image-based practices. Gallery 44 supports over 400 artist members through affordable access to analogue and digital facilities and various professional development opportunities, including conceptual and technical workshops, portfolio reviews and mentorships. Gallery 44 continues to serve an important role in the larger arts community by supporting: · emerging artists through such annual programs as Proof, OUTREACH, Darkroom Club, CameraLinks and CameraReach · Canadian and international artists and curators through dynamic exhibitions and residencies · diverse audiences through public programs such as talks, tours, discussions, screenings, writing groups and performances · writers in every stage of their careers through our vital and prolific publishing program",gallery centered programming areas offer affordable production facilities artist members including darkrooms digital printing ensuring artists working diverse media accessible space experiment develop photo based practices providing similarly accessible gallery space g44 presents dynamic exhibitions reflect range contemporary issues visual forms mentor focused institution curator focused maintain collaborative approach artists play central active role shaping programming supporting artistic development g44 dedicates significant portions programming calendar focusing emerging artists longstanding programs proof cameralinks provide artists cusp explorations seeing widen dialogue contemporary photography equally important mandate provide production exhibition mentorship scholarship opportunities youth gta gallery outreach program example photography workshops youth underserved communities unique program inspires youth develop positive methods sharing stories initiate critical explorations art viewing art making artist centres canada providing ongoing hands arts education youth award winning education programs encourage greater visual literacy fostering generation artists gallery centre contemporary photography charitable non profit artist centre committed supporting multi faceted approaches photography lens based media founded establish supportive environment development artistic practice gallery mandate provide context meaningful reflection dialogue contemporary photography gallery committed programs reflect continuously changing definition photography presenting wide range practices engage timely critical explorations medium exhibitions public engagement education programs production facilities objective explore artistic cultural historic social political implications image expanding visual world gallery founded group artists need production facilities joined share darkroom studio space forming collective important step making facilities affordable creating supportive community artists common goals collective began mounting exhibitions began offering photography workshops gallery moved original location niagara street bathurst street production exhibition facilities expanded serve growing membership severe lack photographic education elementary secondary schools gallery began education schools program gallery moved richmond improve centre exhibition production facilities widen audience centralized location main floor space includes administrative office main gallery adjacent vitrines gallery host seven annual exhibitions members gallery exclusively showcases work members gallery square foot accessible facilities basement include darkrooms shooting studio scanning lab wide format digital printing print finishing area resource library production gallery highlights works produced facilities history gallery prioritized equitable access breaking barriers arts artists audiences youth programming outside downtown core collaborating numerous community partners outside sector supporting artistic experimentation risk taking providing accessible public programs production support emerging practitioners diverse artists young people gta gallery partners include imaginenative images festival scotiabank contact photography festival toronto district school board ocad university trinity square video nia centre arts tangled art disability gallery continues develop evolve remained committed history artist centre relates fostering collaborative decision making sharing leadership roles retaining spirit artist centre members board staff work develop implement programs highlight unique artistic practices engage wide audience increase access understanding image based practices gallery supports artist members affordable access analogue digital facilities various professional development opportunities including conceptual technical workshops portfolio reviews mentorships gallery continues serve important role larger arts community supporting emerging artists annual programs proof outreach darkroom club cameralinks camerareach canadian international artists curators dynamic exhibitions residencies diverse audiences public programs talks tours discussions screenings writing groups performances writers stage careers vital prolific publishing program
"In 2015, 221A opened Semi-Public, a 3,000 square foot outdoor exhibition site, complicating its role in Vancouver’s contemporary art ecology. However, as the organization grew, it found its ambitions increasingly restricted by the disciplinary conventions, compressed timelines, and precarious economics of the artist-run centre (ARC). In his history of magisterial artist-run culture in Canada (1962-2012), Vincent Bonin describes how the ARC’s original project of emancipation, of both artist and society, was abandoned after decades of creative stagnation and bureaucratic red tape. The organization likewise found that the methods and logics of the traditional ARC could only interpret the world in various ways; 221A wants to change it. Consequently, 221A’s vision is to support artists to transform the cultural, ecological, and economic contexts they emerge from. Beginning in Fall 2017, 221A’s programming was comprehensively restructured around a ‘fellowship & infrastructure’ model. Unlike a standard exhibition or commission, the fellowship program will host artists over an extended period of time, engaging with contexts, collaborators, ideas, and audiences. Over the course of three to twenty-four months, the fellow will occupy 221A’s former exhibition space and working with the staff to lead the organization’s artistic pursuits. The fellowship program will develop research that leads to new social, cultural, or ecological ‘infrastructure’. 221A defines infrastructure as flexible, semi-permanent projects and systems that exceed traditional forms of (art) production in their capacity to respond to fluctuating realities and needs. Whereas 221A’s peers and mentors—traditional ARC’s and public galleries—are institutions that commission and exhibit artist works, the ‘fellowship & infrastructure’ model empowers artists to use the institution itself as a medium. Fellows will mobilize an expanded set of instruments—finances, communications, facilities, and human resources—to realize projects that intervene in, and hopefully transform, our contexts in contemporary society. 221A is a non-profit artist-run centre that presents exhibitions, talks, publications and special projects that explore the role of design in the shaping of contemporary societies. Beginning as a student-led initiative in 2005, the organization was initially animated by an opposition to the division between contemporary art and design. Leaving the university grounds in 2008 to establish its first public exhibition space, the organization would be shaped by the history and upheavals of its new home in Chinatown, the embattled neighbourhood itself a microcosm of a global economic recession and the transformation of Vancouver before and after the 2010 Winter Olympics.",221a opened semi public square foot outdoor exhibition complicating role vancouver contemporary art ecology organization grew ambitions increasingly restricted disciplinary conventions compressed timelines precarious economics artist centre arc history magisterial artist culture canada vincent bonin describes arc original project emancipation artist society abandoned decades creative stagnation bureaucratic red tape organization likewise methods logics traditional arc interpret world various ways 221a wants change consequently 221a vision support artists transform cultural ecological economic contexts emerge beginning fall 221a programming comprehensively restructured fellowship infrastructure model unlike standard exhibition commission fellowship program host artists extended period engaging contexts collaborators ideas audiences course months fellow occupy 221a exhibition space working staff lead organization artistic pursuits fellowship program develop research leads social cultural ecological infrastructure 221a defines infrastructure flexible semi permanent projects systems exceed traditional forms art production capacity respond fluctuating realities needs 221a peers mentors traditional arc public galleries institutions commission exhibit artist works fellowship infrastructure model empowers artists use institution medium fellows mobilize expanded set instruments finances communications facilities human resources realize projects intervene hopefully transform contexts contemporary society 221a non profit artist centre presents exhibitions talks publications special projects explore role design shaping contemporary societies beginning student led initiative organization initially animated opposition division contemporary art design leaving university grounds establish public exhibition space organization shaped history upheavals home chinatown embattled neighbourhood microcosm global economic recession transformation vancouver winter olympics

Of particular interest is work that crosses the boundaries between the two disciplines, exploring their common areas of praxis—a distinct aspect of the history of cultural practice in this region. Artspeak has played a significant role in addressing the historical, social and intellectual conditions of contemporary visual and language arts production from the West Coast. We aim to support the practices of emerging and established artists and writers from this region and beyond by providing opportunities to exhibit, publish and present new work to enthusiastic audiences. Artspeak actively contributes to cultural communities through our commitment to artists producing challenging, innovative work in diverse media, our affiliation with like-minded organizations and the public interest we generate in contemporary art.",artspeak founded curator cate rimmer artist keith higgins writer jeff derksen early association kootenay school writing served situate artspeak unique interdisciplinary community visual artists writers critics artspeak operated artists visual language arts share concerns relation theory practice contemporary art mandate gallery exhibit contemporary art encourage dialogue visual art writing particular work crosses boundaries disciplines exploring common areas praxis distinct aspect history cultural practice region artspeak played significant role addressing historical social intellectual conditions contemporary visual language arts production west coast aim support practices emerging established artists writers region providing opportunities exhibit publish present work enthusiastic audiences artspeak actively contributes cultural communities commitment artists producing challenging innovative work diverse media affiliation like minded organizations public generate contemporary art

"Espacio P is a benchmark among alternative spaces that are self-organised by artists in Madrid. Launched and directed by the multimedia artist, Pedro Garhel (Tenerife, 1952-2005), it developed collaborative dynamics of research, training and production. It also implemented the use of shared resources and means of diffusion that remained practically unexplored at that time in Spain.Its hybrid structure was the result of opening up and merging different artistic concepts and fields as well as crossing over and beyond the traditional limits of the exhibition space, the stage and the laboratory for research and production. Its aim was to explore the edges between the visual, performance and sound arts, so that different practices and languages were linked, through the sharing of a single space with multiple functions. Moreover, its programme was inclusive and socially engaging: it was a place where artists created community and art was synonymous with life and with shared experiences and knowledge.Between 1981 and 1997, Espacio P organised all kinds of activities related to performance, photography, installations, visual poetry, postal art, film, video and experimental music, as well as electronic and virtual reality art, at a time when the majority of art galleries and museums were celebrating the resurgence of painting.The remarkable trajectory of the activities of Espacio P is related to several thematic hubs: do-it-yourself culture between fluxus and punk; action art and audiovisual language; the gender question; interventions in the public space; and the transition from the analog era to digital culture. Overall, it aimed to focus attention on artistic practices which were facing up to the challenges of the globalisation of culture, of production and of the markets. In addition, those practices tackled alternatives to the impact of media power by the construction of new spaces as well as individual and collective identities in a period of transition towards the post-industrial society. Space P is one of the pioneer initiatives of artistic self-management in Spain. Located in the center of Madrid between 1981 and 1997, he set up new training and production models, and introduced methods to manage resources and collaborations that have not been explored until then in this country. Space P was one of the first Spanish alternative spaces, active between 1981 and 1997. The “P” resulted in “performance” as well as “polival” as well as “political”. Throughout its trajectory it was also presented as “Performance Alternative Space”, “Polival Space”, “Art of Present”, “Center of Audiovisual Arts”. It was an independent experimenting initiative, a non-formal learning place of extracademic arts, production and exhibition, as well as a meeting place and exchange of experiences and knowledge, from participating practices.

At the same time, its multipurpose spaces are available to individuals, organizations and other agencies for the hosting of events, presentations, seminars, symposia, conferences and scientific or other workshops. The House of Culture and Research is an organization that specializes in four pillars: contemporary arts, science, innovation and social impact. It is a natural evolution of the Artos Foundation which, for 21 years (2000-2021), has contributed to local and European culture in the fields of cultural research, creativity, science and social impact.It offers a platform for scientists, artists, artists and creatives to participate in cultural and international research. Artos House is engaged and stimulates the social challenges of contemporary research, creativity and research. The ARTos Cultural and Research Foundation was founded by the artists Achilleas Kentonis and Maria Papacharalambous. It is a contemporary arts and science center dedicated to research and creativity: two magical worlds of adventure and discovery, encompassing sojourns into the fields of learning, chaos and imagination. Its premises, both transcendental and material, inspire the contemporary artist/creator and the scientist/creator alike, offering to both a platform, promoting them at a local as well as at an international level, with quality being the main criterion.The Foundation is housed in premises which once hosted the bakeries of Nicosia’s Agii Omologites parish, hence the inspiration for its name: “artos” or “bread”, the product of the bakeries, a staple dietary item for the people of Cyprus through the ages; at the same time, there’s “ARTos” (ARTs Operating System), which places us directly in the modern era of the apotheosis of Technology which, incidentally, we should never forget, etymologically means “the systematic treatment of an art”, and tha Art, according to Zenios, “…is the Bread (artos) which gladdens the soul”! The very premises themselves constitute another unique experience to the visitor. The traditional architecture of the 1901 building converses with the industrial edifice of 1950 which once housed the bakeries, while at the same time we see incorporated into the entire complex a modern extension completed in 2003, thus creating an autonomous work of art marked by artful plasticity and rhythm. One could say that this is a space inspiring and challenging creativity, a situation, in any case, constituting that which is desired. Furthermore, during the refurbishment process and by opportune coincidence, we discovered and reconstructed a complex comprising nine unique ancient tombs dating back to the Hellenistic or, according to others, archaic period. In this way, the Foundation, with a solid foothold in the past, has, at the same time, its sights turned towards the future; it is inspired by ancient art and, through the use of modern technology, serves Cyprus’ timeless civilization, providing a platform for artistic and scientific creativity on a local and at the same time international level.",functions multidimensional space organizing undertaking production multifaceted events world theatre music dance cinema visual arts letters sciences multipurpose spaces available individuals organizations agencies hosting events presentations seminars symposia conferences scientific workshops house culture research organization specializes pillars contemporary arts science innovation social impact natural evolution artos foundation years contributed local european culture fields cultural research creativity science social impact platform scientists artists artists creatives participate cultural international research artos house engaged stimulates social challenges contemporary research creativity research artos cultural research foundation founded artists achilleas kentonis maria papacharalambous contemporary arts science center dedicated research creativity magical worlds adventure discovery encompassing sojourns fields learning chaos imagination premises transcendental material inspire contemporary artist creator scientist creator alike offering platform promoting local international level quality main criterion foundation housed premises hosted bakeries nicosia agii omologites parish inspiration artos bread product bakeries staple dietary item people cyprus ages artos arts operating places directly modern era apotheosis technology incidentally forget etymologically means systematic treatment art tha art according zenios bread artos gladdens soul premises constitute unique experience visitor traditional architecture building converses industrial edifice housed bakeries incorporated entire complex modern extension completed creating autonomous work art marked artful plasticity rhythm say space inspiring challenging creativity situation case constituting desired furthermore refurbishment process opportune coincidence discovered reconstructed complex comprising unique ancient tombs dating hellenistic according archaic period way foundation solid foothold past sights turned future inspired ancient art use modern technology serves cyprus timeless civilization providing platform artistic scientific creativity local international level

"The Red Cactus Art Studio is a workshop created in August 2020 at the initiative of Helène Battaini, an artist. The site of creation and exhibition is constantly evolving reflecting the artistic research of Helène Battaini. Born of four walls forgotten in the historical center, the Red Cactus Art Studio now includes an exhibition space, a library, musical instruments, plastic material available for every Friday when the gallery is open to the public. Helène Battaini presents its work throughout the year and sometimes organises exhibitions of other artists and events of short and regular events in order to propose a variety of cultural works outside the city. The structure I created is a workshop called the Red Cactus Art Studio (2 red carpets, Montpellier). I wanted to make it a place called ""social art"". From my point of view it answers questions of current society, i.e. preserving the independence of its own culture and its accessibility to its own heritage. One day per week the place is open to the public and participatory. The material is free of use to anyone in communication. I have materials for the practice of plastics and also musical instruments and books. There is no need for writing, paying or being able to sit on my own things. I have no need to be able to use them as part of my body to make them. My space can be seen as a work in the sense that it reflects a thought developed for progress (from society) and that it goes through an aesthetic research. However, it is constantly evolving so it may be an installation or performance rather than a final work.

"Tilde is a para-institution for contemporary art and research, presenting projects in several forms and places, both in its space in Amsterdam and collaborating with other spaces in The Netherlands and abroad. While organizing specific projects and off-site events, carefully unfolding experimental practices in close collaboration with artists, thinkers, writers, researchers, and the community, Tilde aims to create connections between local and international, young and older practitioners. Tilde promotes interdisciplinary dialogues and encourages involvement with other non–profit spaces, as well as institutional and educational systems nationally and internationally.It is run by artist and curator Diego Diez, who was previously co-directing the Amsterdam project space Plat- (2017-2019) and organizing group exhibitions such as Lockers (2017, 2019). After co-directing Plat- for two years I decided to work on my own and I founded Tilde as a some sort of next step of Plat-. Tilde aims to be able to reshape itself for the needs of the artists it works with, not being tied to a set of walls and lights, but with the possibility to offer to the artists what they might be looking for at that time of their careers.Since its start in October 2019 Tilde has created a line where works by stablished artists such as Francisco de Goya y Lucientes, Laure Prouvost or Moyra Davey are shown next to younger artists such as Vincent Verhoef, Maria Nolla Mateos or Sara Milio, a.o.. Another characteristic of the space is the intention to put in context the work of artists working in Amsterdam with international artist, allowing both parts to discover different contexts within a similar approach to art making. Mostly presenting duo or small group shows the aim of the project is to offer a space for conversation between different generations and points of departure, with a public presentation understood as an exhibition but with an important part behind the scenes, where the artists discuss and share their knowledge and methodologies. Relationships make up an important part of the shows at Tilde, especially as it is based in my apartment: the artists usually stay there for a week for set up. This means the conversations about the show happen more informally, like when cooking breakfast. While theoretically grounded, my approach to curating is based more on direct relationships with artists, proximity, friendship and the processual development of exhibitions, rather than working on a thematic base.",tilde para institution contemporary art research presenting projects forms places space amsterdam collaborating spaces netherlands abroad organizing specific projects events carefully unfolding experimental practices close collaboration artists thinkers writers researchers community tilde aims create connections local international young older practitioners tilde promotes interdisciplinary dialogues encourages involvement non profit spaces institutional educational systems nationally internationally artist curator diego diez previously directing amsterdam project space plat organizing group exhibitions lockers directing plat years decided work founded tilde sort step plat tilde aims able reshape needs artists works tied set walls lights possibility offer artists looking careers start october tilde created line works stablished artists francisco goya lucientes laure prouvost moyra davey shown younger artists vincent verhoef maria nolla mateos sara milio characteristic space intention context work artists working amsterdam international artist allowing parts discover different contexts similar approach art making presenting duo group shows aim project offer space conversation different generations points departure public presentation understood exhibition important scenes artists discuss share knowledge methodologies relationships make important shows tilde especially based apartment artists usually stay week set means conversations happen informally like cooking breakfast theoretically grounded approach curating based direct relationships artists proximity friendship processual development exhibitions working thematic base

"NICC [New International Cultural Center] creates spaces for interaction between visual artists, institutions and society, with specific attention to the position of the visual artist, on a local, regional and international level.NICC plays an active role in the support and self-realisation of the professional visual artist. Its aim is to function as first contact and representatives for visual artists, striving for a qualitative social framework enabling the visual artist to develop his/her practice in a professional and autonomous way. The International Cultural Centre (ICC) in Antwerp was founded in 1970 and was the first public institution for contemporary art in Flanders. During the 70s and early 80s the organization contributed significantly to the stimulation and dissemination of the Belgian and international avant-garde. The shutting down of the ICC (1998) resulted in the occupation of its building by the group ‘Hit&Run’, this resulted in the establishment of the NICC.From 1998 to 2002 the NICC was run by artists such as Luc Tuymans, Guillaume Bijl and Danny Devos. In addition to an exhibition program, the NICC was committed to the advocacy of visual artists. From 2002 to 2006, the NICC focused on social policy. Three new non-profit organisations were founded by people who had previously worked at the NICC: Extra City, Objectif Exhibitions, and Air Antwerpen. Indirectly, the BAM and Kunstenloket support centres were also established at the request of the NICC.From 2008 to 2012 the NICC was managed by a new group of artists. Despite the limited budget , a rich, public program was developed in Antwerp’s Tulpstraat.In 2013, the NICC moved to Brussels to further develop its supra-local operations and influence. From this location, the NICC Vitrine, a diverse program of artist talks and vitrine presentations was realized with local and international artists such as Dennis Tyfus, Sammy Baloji, Shana Moulton, etc. Ahead of the 20 year anniversary, NICC returned to Antwerp South in 2017. In 2018, NICC presented two large-scale projects: OPEN STUDIO’S 2018 and 20 YEARS NICC (view the powerpoint of 20 YEARS NICC here). With OPEN STUDIO’S NICC wanted to focus attention on the need for affordable workspaces and cultural usage of vacant space, from this grew the initiative to bring all Flemish studio organizations together in the UFO platform. In the summer of 2019, NICC organized a debate in collaboration with De Nor on the sense and nonsense of the artist status for visual artists. At the M HKA, NICC reacted to the policy plan and announced cuts in a visual way with Without Artists No Art (2020). In the summer of 2020, NICC became part of the Artists Coalition. During the period of 2018-2021, the NICC also maintained a constant conversation with advice and critiques to the Cabinet and the administration of the Department of Culture. The NICC also spent 1.5 years as a partner establishing the correct pay framework “right is right” and the federal holistic reform of the socioeconomic status of the Artist, Working in the Arts (WITA).Anno 2023, the NICC continues to question the realization of the above-mentioned trajectories in daily practice and wants to know how we can continue to stimulate dialogue between governments, support structures and interest groups in order to strengthen the position of the artist in a sustainable way.",nicc international cultural center creates spaces interaction visual artists institutions society specific attention position visual artist local regional international level nicc plays active role support self realisation professional visual artist aim function contact representatives visual artists striving qualitative social framework enabling visual artist develop practice professional autonomous way international cultural centre icc antwerp founded public institution contemporary art flanders 70s early 80s organization contributed significantly stimulation dissemination belgian international avant garde shutting icc resulted occupation building group hit resulted establishment nicc nicc artists luc tuymans guillaume bijl danny devos addition exhibition program nicc committed advocacy visual artists nicc focused social policy non profit organisations founded people previously worked nicc city objectif exhibitions air antwerpen indirectly bam kunstenloket support centres established request nicc nicc managed group artists despite limited budget rich public program developed antwerp tulpstraat nicc moved brussels develop supra local operations influence location nicc vitrine diverse program artist talks vitrine presentations realized local international artists dennis tyfus sammy baloji shana moulton ahead anniversary nicc returned antwerp south nicc presented scale projects studio years nicc view powerpoint years nicc studio nicc wanted focus attention need affordable workspaces cultural usage vacant space grew initiative bring flemish studio organizations ufo platform summer nicc organized debate collaboration sense nonsense artist status visual artists hka nicc reacted policy plan announced cuts visual way artists art summer nicc artists coalition period nicc maintained constant conversation advice critiques cabinet administration department culture nicc spent years partner establishing correct pay framework right right federal holistic reform socioeconomic status artist working arts wita anno nicc continues question realization mentioned trajectories daily practice wants know continue stimulate dialogue governments support structures groups order strengthen position artist sustainable way

"The Mothership education program organizes its pedagogy around 5 steps of color research. In the first step, we identify the plants, in the second we forage or source the plants, in the third we extract the dyes, in the fourth, we transform the dye into various media, and in the final step, we apply the dyes to textiles and other materials. These five steps are circular, it is a process that repeats itself. Students can intervene in a single step, or go through the entire process, as relevant to their needs and practice. Classes and workshops focused on natural dyeing and other textile techniques, sustainable planting, and land management, are organized and facilitated by the Mothership as an effort to bring awareness to the need to preserve traditional practices and encourage artists to explore these techniques and materials in their work. This educational programming is offered in different formats and taught by local and international expert artists throughout the year. Scholarships to local students will be available. The Mothership is an artist-led project by Yto Barrada creating space and time for research, artistic exploration, and retreat, inspired by natural dyes. Based in Tangier, the project is envisioned as an ‘eco-campus’ for growing, making, and learning natural dyes and indigenous traditions, and a place for experimental collective artistic practice through art residencies and workshops. The Mothership will be “a place to conjure pan-African eco-feminist practices into being”. Founder Yto Barrada grew up in her parent's home adjacent to the wilder lands which now house the Mothership; in 2003 she moved with her family to live in the Gardener’s House, and now share her time between New York and Tangier. Since then a growing circle of collaborators and friends have joined her efforts to help envision and manifest The Mothership’s Natural Dye Garden, residency and education programs.",mothership education program organizes pedagogy steps color research step identify plants second forage source plants extract dyes fourth transform dye various media final step apply dyes textiles materials steps circular process repeats students intervene single step entire process relevant needs practice classes workshops focused natural dyeing textile techniques sustainable planting land management organized facilitated mothership effort bring awareness need preserve traditional practices encourage artists explore techniques materials work educational programming offered different formats taught local international expert artists scholarships local students available mothership artist led project yto barrada creating space research artistic exploration retreat inspired natural dyes based tangier project envisioned eco campus growing making learning natural dyes indigenous traditions experimental collective artistic practice art residencies workshops mothership conjure pan african eco feminist practices founder yto barrada grew parent home adjacent wilder lands house mothership moved family live gardener house share york tangier growing circle collaborators friends joined efforts help envision manifest mothership natural dye garden residency education programs
"The Cédille carried materials from a variety of artists associated with Fluxus, including books from Dick Higgins’s Something Else Press as well as interactive multiples published by Daniel Spoerri’s MAT Editions and the Fluxus imprint, organized by George Maciunas. However, none of Brecht and Filliou’s works initiated there seemed to come to fruition; or, their material structure emphasized the possibility of endless reconfiguration. The Cédille’s haphazard, almost anti-retail display made its wares indistinguishable from the surrounding works-in-progress, an appropriate set-up for the sale of editions whose openness to change and alteration belonged to a nonconventional trajectory of artistic objecthood indebted to the readymades of Duchamp and the indeterminate compositions of John Cage. More like an atelier than white cube gallery, the Cédille was an extrapolation of the Fluxus model of the artwork-in-flux into an artist-run economy of production, distribution, and exchange that would, to borrow language from Maciunas’s 1963 manifesto, “promote a revolutionary flood and tide in art.” Given recent economic and political events, I am now encouraged to think of the transformations on the art object enacted by various Fluxus practices in terms of aderegulation of the art object, for that very term first came into use in the early 1960s in relation to emerging federal policy changes to the rail and truck transportation industries. These historical facts seem fitting, for what I am about to narrate is a story of the deregulation not only of the art object but also of its movement through certain art networks, motivated by artists’ frustration and disgust at networks’ paradoxical tendency to consolidate power. The Cédille was a shop that kept no regular hours and had no tidy, reliable stock of merchandise. Still, it subsisted until 1968, when in March, Brecht and Filliou realized they could no longer afford to pay rent. By October, they had defaulted on a contract that should have carried the project into 1974. And thus we must admit that the Cédille, if indeed it was meant to function as a store, failed as a commercial venture. In 1962, Filliou realized La Galerie Legitime, a travel and miniature personal gallery, which is contained in a castle. Filliou is presenting its creations or those of other artists (1962). Installed in Villafranche-sur-Mer, Robert Filliou opens in 1965 with Georges Brech: The Cédille that smiles, a non-boutique designed as an international centre of permanent creation. It is born of films and poems.... Extrait du très bon article de Natilee HarrenLa cédille qui ne finit pas: Robert Filliou, George Brecht, and Fluxus in Villefranche (deregulation version) Intégralité : http://www.artandeducation.net/paper/la-cedille-qui-ne-finit-pas-robert-filliou-george-brecht-and-fluxus-in-villefranche/ In the summer of 1965, George Brecht and Robert Filliou, with the support of their partners Donna and Marianne, opened a shop at 12 rue de May in Villefranche-sur-Mer, a seaside village just east of Nice, France. The space, 36 meters square, with a canary yellow awning and chalkboard sign in the window, was called La Cédille Qui Sourit, or “The Cedilla That Smiles.” Conceived first as an English bookshop “under the sign of humor,” it was actually, as Filliou has recounted, “a sort of workshop and of shop, of nonshop would we say now, for we were never commercially registered, and the Cédille was always shut, opening only upon request of visitors to our homes.” The artists, both associated with the international, neo-avant-garde Fluxus collective, called their shop a “Center of Permanent Creation,” for they were continually producing research, letters, jokes, puzzles, games, recipes, poems, drawings, and events. Yet there were few unannounced visitors to the Cédille, or at least ones who were successful in visiting, since the shop did not have a telephone and Brecht and Filliou seemed not to spend much time there. The artists presided more often at one of the nearby cafés, devising more of the visual gags they called “One Minute Scenarios,” “dis-inventing” objects, adding to their “Anthology of Misunderstandings,” or talking with their friends Alfred the bricklayer, Antoine the fisherman, Fernand the plumber, or anyone else who happened to drop by.",cédille carried materials variety artists associated fluxus including books dick higgins press interactive multiples published daniel spoerri mat editions fluxus imprint organized george maciunas brecht filliou works initiated come fruition material structure emphasized possibility endless reconfiguration cédille haphazard anti retail display wares indistinguishable surrounding works progress appropriate set sale editions openness change alteration belonged nonconventional trajectory artistic objecthood indebted readymades duchamp indeterminate compositions john cage like atelier cube gallery cédille extrapolation fluxus model artwork flux artist economy production distribution exchange borrow language maciunas manifesto promote revolutionary flood tide art given recent economic political events encouraged think transformations art object enacted various fluxus practices terms aderegulation art object term came use early 1960s relation emerging federal policy changes rail truck transportation industries historical facts fitting narrate story deregulation art object movement art networks motivated artists frustration disgust networks paradoxical tendency consolidate power cédille shop kept regular tidy reliable stock merchandise subsisted march brecht filliou realized longer afford pay rent october defaulted contract carried project admit cédille meant function store failed commercial venture filliou realized galerie legitime travel miniature personal gallery contained castle filliou presenting creations artists installed villafranche mer robert filliou opens georges brech cédille smiles non boutique designed international centre permanent creation born films poems extrait très bon natilee harrenla cédille qui finit pas robert filliou george brecht fluxus villefranche deregulation version intégralité summer george brecht robert filliou support partners donna marianne opened shop rue villefranche mer seaside village just east nice france space meters square canary yellow awning chalkboard sign window called cédille qui sourit cedilla smiles conceived english bookshop sign humor actually filliou recounted sort workshop shop nonshop say commercially registered cédille shut opening request visitors homes artists associated international neo avant garde fluxus collective called shop center permanent creation continually producing research letters jokes puzzles games recipes poems drawings events unannounced visitors cédille ones successful visiting shop did telephone brecht filliou spend artists presided nearby cafés devising visual gags called minute scenarios dis inventing objects adding anthology misunderstandings talking friends alfred bricklayer antoine fisherman fernand plumber happened drop

It endeavors to establish an open space for artists to mature at their own pace, and to provide an environment conducive for artists to experiment, experience and exchange ideas. The Artists Village (TAV) is a contemporary art group in Singapore. Founded by contemporary artist Tang Da Wu in 1988 at 61-B Lorong Gambas in Sembawang.

The Artist Village was Singapore's first artist colony, which enables artists to explore radical new ways and ideologies in making art that is in synch with the societal changes and state affairs in the late 1980's. From 1989 onwards, the village came alive with avant-garde performances and art exhibitions with 7 art shows that year. At the height of the village history, The Artist Village housed 35 artists with 50 other artists participating in other art activities organised by the village. In 1990, The Artist Village organised a 24-hour art event called The Time Show. It brought together artists working in all forms of multimedia in one art show.

"Artists’ initiative Club Solo presents solo exhibitions of leading artists. They are an inspiration to several generations of artists. In addition to new work, they also show key works spanning their entire careers. The solo artists also curate the exhibitions: they get total freedom to experiment in the solo exhibition. By doing this, they give the visitor an insight in their work and way of working in a unique way.Besides this, the solo artists determine the peripheral programme and the content of the publication. Club Solo organises four solo exhibitions each year. The selection of the artists is a joint selection by the core members of Club Solo. To challenge the solo artists and to put their artistic position into perspective, curators from two museums – Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Antwerp – contribute one work from their museum collection to each exhibition. These works are exhibited in a separate space from Club Solo. The museums are free to choose the reacting work. Prior to the exhibition, conversations take place in the studio of the artist and in the museum between the solo artist and the curator of the Van Abbemuseum or M HKA. Accompanying each exhibition is a publication that contains an essay on the artist’s work and a review of the work selected from the museum collection. It also has photographs of the exhibition. Each artist directs their respective publication and hand-picks a writer.

Other projects are only on invitation and are managed directly by the executive. So we do not accept requests after the opening of the open call. Mars opens in Milan on 3 December 2008. It is a space managed by artists and destined for a curious audience to know more about contemporary art. The Pasteur space is born from an original idea of Lorenza Boisi and was initiated with the complexity of other artists a program for Mars, performance events, exhibitions and art, on the self-managed model.In the years following the MARS project, they participated: Alessandro Roma, Andrea Dojmi, Antonio Barletta, Dacia Manto, David Casini, Ivan Malerba, Jacopo Milliani, Laura Pugno, Lidia SANVITO, Lorenza Boisi, Luca Trevisani, Luigi Presicce, Manuel Cerutti, Nicola Gobccato, Nicolas Tobzato, Simona.",mars like delegated accident physical space especially project decides structured according classic calendar order progressively respond artistic needs different participants mars like potential box cube aesthetically defective container faces diversity inventivity project mars programme projects invitation managed directly executive accept requests opening mars opens milan december space managed artists destined curious audience know contemporary art pasteur space born original idea lorenza boisi initiated complexity artists program mars performance events exhibitions art self managed model years following mars project participated alessandro roma andrea dojmi antonio barletta dacia manto david casini ivan malerba jacopo milliani laura pugno lidia sanvito lorenza boisi luca trevisani luigi presicce manuel cerutti nicola gobccato nicolas tobzato simona

"Since 2006, Curry Vavart has developed workshops and temporary exhibition spaces, fully managed by artists, installed in damaged buildings to be rehabilitated in short or long term terms. The collective encourages collaborations and exchanges of knowledge, including those of collective artistic events. To this end, an exhibition space has been created in 18th, the ""CP5"". The collective group is composed of hundreds of volunteers and nearly 10,000 members and sympathis, and supports each year almost 150 associated projects and artists. It currently manages 2000m2 of workshops shared in 20th and 18th rounds, with the Parcoires of the Parcoires and the Coalitions of the Coalitions. The CP5 is a space of artistic exhibitions, located in the entrance hall of an old SNCF dresser, fully equipped with 5mm against this project. Two years ago, this building was located in the 18th district of Paris, welcoming the last workers of the SNCF Pulur site, currently in repair. The entrance hall is a place of choice: only and unique access to the clothing, shower and furniture, used by hundreds of wines each day, of wines intended for the display of its walls. Today, the disabled building has been invested by the harvesters of the SNCF and harvesters. Several volunteers encourage a plastic art commission within the collection Curry Vavart. This committee is piloting the operation of the CP5 exposure space. It examines the exhibition projects submitted to the collection, sets up a program that it validates throughout the collection at its plenary meeting, welcomes artists and accompanys the conduct of exhibitions, including from a logistical point of view.

"Conical is an independent contemporary art space that supports the production and presentation of new work by local and international artists. With an interest in spatial, temporal and conceptual movements in visual art, Conical’s focus is on site-related activities, particularly those that embrace transient and fragmented responses to place. Emphasising a reciprocal exchange between artist and organization, Conical acts as an integral agent in the process of realizing exhibitions and projects. An opportunity is provided for both independent and represented artists to test or consolidate their practice. The provision of time, space and dialogue encourages risk and criticality. Over the past decade Conical has continued to evolve its operational model in response to the currencies of contemporary discourse. Director, Adrien Allen, shapes a flexible program of exhibitions and projects – both internally curated and application based. 2013In an increasingly crowded landscape providing a plethora of choices, Conical has built a particular set of conditions for artists to respond to. Over the past eleven years of continual programming much documentary material has been amassed, including images, text and recorded conversations. Some appears on our website, some has yet to be archived. For many reasons, now feels like the right time to consolidate, reflect upon and develop this material, both as a document and as an instigator of new projects. Beyond memorialising past activities the idea of a ‘living archive’ that further propels Conical’s self-reflexive agenda is of interest and has an exciting potential to manifest in a variety of forms, recasting the Conical project. Conical announces that our current exhibition is the final for the time being. After supporting spatial, temporal and conceptual practices in Melbourne since 2001 Conical will no longer operate an annual program of exhibitions. However, the space will continue to be used for Conical projects, and at other times may be available for hire (all enquiries to info@conical.org.au).",conical independent contemporary art space supports production presentation work local international artists spatial temporal conceptual movements visual art conical focus related activities particularly embrace transient fragmented responses emphasising reciprocal exchange artist organization conical acts integral agent process realizing exhibitions projects opportunity provided independent represented artists test consolidate practice provision space dialogue encourages risk criticality past decade conical continued evolve operational model response currencies contemporary discourse director adrien allen shapes flexible program exhibitions projects internally curated application based 2013in increasingly crowded landscape providing plethora choices conical built particular set conditions artists respond past years continual programming documentary material amassed including images text recorded conversations appears website archived reasons feels like right consolidate reflect develop material document instigator projects memorialising past activities idea living archive propels conical self reflexive agenda exciting potential manifest variety forms recasting conical project conical announces current exhibition final supporting spatial temporal conceptual practices melbourne conical longer operate annual program exhibitions space continue used conical projects times available hire enquiries info conical org

"The MAGMA Contemporary Art Space started his working on the April of 2010, with a three years preparatory work in Romania in Saint George city with the founders and runners of the space – Ágnes-Evelin Kispál (Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts, Intermedia Department), Attila Kispál (Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts, Intermedia Department) and Barnabás Vetró Bodoni till 2013 (Academy of Fine Arts, Cluj and Timisoara). MAGMA is an independent artist run space, the events realised are going on his defined concept, namely to present contemporary art, focusing on media art, workshops, experimental or improvizative music, artist talks, art pedagogy, guided tours, performances; cooperating not only with those who come from the art field but also with musicians, philosophers, or theater etc. Erupts and solidifiesThe birth of Magma Project and a Contemporary Art Space in Saint George Magma is acting in two directions. On the one hand, it is boiling, forming under the surface, on the other hand, it comes to the surface from time to time, erupting. Niklas Luhman’s description of autopoetic may be considered as valid as the (self)-definition of being a collective action. Magma is autopoetic in the sense that it perpetually sustains, resuscitates itself, without considering any kind of formal or thematic restriction. Paradoxically, however, it cannot be perceived as a circular gesture, originating from and returning to itself. It is rather a collective manifestation of a self-functioning unit. In the following we offer a presentation of consecutive eruptions, which trace the movement of Magma, led by Ágnes Evelin Kispál, Barnabás Vetró and Attila Kispál.",magma contemporary art space started working april years preparatory work romania george city founders runners space ágnes evelin kispál hungarian academy fine arts intermedia department attila kispál hungarian academy fine arts intermedia department barnabás vetró bodoni till academy fine arts cluj timisoara magma independent artist space events realised going defined concept present contemporary art focusing media art workshops experimental improvizative music artist talks art pedagogy guided tours performances cooperating come art field musicians philosophers theater erupts solidifiesthe birth magma project contemporary art space george magma acting directions hand boiling forming surface hand comes surface erupting niklas luhman description autopoetic considered valid self definition collective action magma autopoetic sense perpetually sustains resuscitates considering kind formal thematic restriction paradoxically perceived circular gesture originating returning collective manifestation self functioning unit following offer presentation consecutive eruptions trace movement magma led ágnes evelin kispál barnabás vetró attila kispál

"In order to answer the first question, I could say that it depends on projects. With regard to the project ""+/- The Epicery"" or ""Donor-Donor"" the original will was clearly a position and a poetic response to the political will. The demonstration infrastructure and protocols implemented by them were voluntaryly fragile and did not want to be institutionalized, it was a response here and now in the social and artistic context of the age. In the 1990s, there was a gap between the historical and critical nature of Nicolas Bourriaud. There were no structures that welcomed the work of the young artists. They were also used to make their own tools. With regard to question 2 and for me, I voluntarily resell the concept of work by the author, and let the appreciation of others consider this work as ""work"". The archiving of a documentation, reflection on this subject, its replaying under the plastic, sound, film or still installation forms an integral part of my work. Tising bridges between curatorial and artistic practices has always been either, one that can serve as a narrative to the other. But the most important thing in this regard has always been to promote the spirit and intelligence of the collective, for which the story takes all its meaning and value of being a vecuist.

"The context of art in Japan is different from the European context to have a much weaker field of knowledge of art and a more dynamic internal art market. Since then, institutions do not have the first role in establishing the definition of art and performing aesthetic judgment. The museums do not really have autonomy and exhibitions are mostly the result of private projects of the world's media or sometimes local politics. Japanese artists are used to pay for the existence of public. For contemporary art artists, the recommended strategy is to be recognized as a national artist who is not a nationalist. We do not think that the space of the ""Palais des Paris"" is a work. Our aim was to produce an articulation between the design of an artist producing an object and a local Japanese audience on the one hand. This art is a work of dialogue with the artist, contextualization and translation to the public in order to reach an understanding without interest. If we can consider our work as a ""work"", then it results in less space than the art of the language. The film from a residency can then also be considered as ""work"", it is by means of an image-text article based on this type of media.",context art japan different european context weaker field knowledge art dynamic internal art market institutions role establishing definition art performing aesthetic judgment museums really autonomy exhibitions result private projects world media local politics japanese artists used pay existence public contemporary art artists recommended strategy recognized national artist nationalist think space palais paris work aim produce articulation design artist producing object local japanese audience hand art work dialogue artist contextualization translation public order reach understanding consider work work results space art language film residency considered work means image text based type media
"In history, Glasbox was conceived to respond to a particular need, that of the distribution of artists to the beautiful art of Paris. These artists are looking for spaces to show their work which are neither institutions nor commercial spaces, they do not want to be emancipated but also because these spaces are difficult to access new practices, without great visibility. Glassbox's programming remains in this interview, allowing great freedom of programming and choice of choice, creating an alternative to art centres or other structures that are more impermissible to search, to the wrong way, to the wrong way, or to put it to the wrong place. I do not think that space or function can be considered as a work, in the sense that its vocation is to welcome or make it germinate again. It is not only an empty box in which we would have something without any impact on this thing but a little like a machine, composed of places, tools, people who pass it, which affects the work that is placed in it. However, I think that in our practice in this space, methods can be similar to those of artists during creation: experimenting with formats, looking at things done and analysing them, modifying them in one sense or another by using them in one way or another by using them.",history glasbox conceived respond particular need distribution artists beautiful art paris artists looking spaces work institutions commercial spaces want emancipated spaces difficult access practices great visibility glassbox programming remains interview allowing great freedom programming choice choice creating alternative art centres structures impermissible search wrong way wrong way wrong think space function considered work sense vocation welcome make germinate box impact thing little like machine composed places tools people pass affects work placed think practice space methods similar artists creation experimenting formats looking things analysing modifying sense using way using
