"The Museum of Conceptual Art was founded in the 1970 by Tom Marioni, describing it as a ""social artwork"".The museum moved into its official location on January 3, 1973 in San Francisco, California. Until the museum closed in 1984, he organized many groundbreaking shows, including Sound Sculpture As in 1970. MOCA has entered history as one of the first alternative art spaces. Marioni had one-person shows in several significant venues for early conceptual art, among them the Richard Demarco Gallery in Edinburgh in 1972 and Gallery Foksal in Warsaw in 1975. In 1977 he had a solo show, The Sound of Flight, at the de Young. After the closing of MOCA, Marioni continued his commitment to “a social work of art"" with the ongoing Society of Independent Artists.

"Gallery 44 is centered on three programming areas: We offer affordable production facilities to over 400 artist members, including darkrooms and digital printing, ensuring that artists working across diverse media have an accessible space to experiment and develop their photo-based practices.Providing a similarly accessible gallery space, G44 presents dynamic exhibitions that reflect a range of contemporary issues and visual forms. As a mentor-focused institution, rather than a curator-focused one, we maintain a collaborative approach in which artists play a central and active role in shaping programming and supporting one another’s artistic development. G44 dedicates significant portions of our programming calendar each year to focusing on emerging artists. Longstanding programs, such as Proof and Cameralinks, provide a place for artists at the cusp of their own explorations into seeing to widen the dialogue around contemporary photography.An equally important part of our mandate is to provide production, exhibition, mentorship and scholarship opportunities to youth throughout the GTA. Gallery 44’s OUTREACH program, for example, offers photography workshops to youth from underserved communities. This unique program inspires youth to develop positive methods of sharing their stories and to initiate critical explorations into art-viewing and art-making. As one of the only artist-run centres in Canada providing ongoing, hands-on arts education to youth, our award-winning education programs encourage greater visual literacy, while fostering a new generation of artists. Gallery 44 Centre for Contemporary Photography is a charitable, non-profit, artist-run centre committed to supporting multi-faceted approaches to photography and lens-based media. Founded in 1979 to establish a supportive environment for the development of artistic practice, Gallery 44’s mandate is to provide a context for meaningful reflection and dialogue on contemporary photography. Gallery 44 is committed to programs that reflect the continuously changing definition of photography by presenting a wide range of practices that engage timely and critical explorations of the medium. Through exhibitions, public engagement, education programs and production facilities our objective is to explore the artistic, cultural, historic, social and political implications of the image in our ever-expanding visual world. Gallery 44 was founded in 1979 by a small group of artists in need of production facilities who joined together to share darkroom and studio space. Forming a collective was an important first step in making facilities affordable and in creating a supportive community of artists with common goals. In 1980, the collective began mounting exhibitions and in 1981 began offering photography workshops. Gallery 44 moved from its original location on Niagara Street to Bathurst Street in 1986, where both the production and exhibition facilities were expanded to serve a growing membership. Due to a severe lack of photographic education in elementary and secondary schools, Gallery 44 began its Education in the Schools program in 1987. In 1994, Gallery 44 moved to 401 Richmond St. W. to improve the centre's exhibition and production facilities and to widen its audience through a more centralized location. The main floor of our space currently includes the administrative office, main gallery and adjacent vitrines gallery that host our seven annual exhibitions and our Members’ Gallery, which exclusively showcases the work of our members. Gallery 44’s 2,673 square foot, accessible facilities are located in the basement of 401 and include darkrooms, a shooting studio, scanning lab, wide format digital printing, print finishing area, resource library, and the Production Gallery which highlights works produced in our facilities. Throughout its history Gallery 44 has prioritized equitable access by breaking down barriers to the arts for artists, audiences and youth. We do so by programming outside of the downtown core, collaborating with numerous community partners both within and outside of our sector, supporting artistic experimentation and risk-taking and providing accessible public programs and production support to emerging practitioners, diverse artists and young people from across the GTA. Gallery 44’s partners include: ImagineNATIVE, Images Festival, Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival, Toronto District School Board, OCAD University, Trinity Square Video, NIA Centre for the Arts, Tangled Art + Disability and many more. While Gallery 44 continues to develop and evolve we have remained committed to our history as an artist-run centre, which in part relates to fostering collaborative decision-making and the sharing of leadership roles. Retaining the spirit of an artist-run centre, members, Board and staff work together to develop and implement programs that highlight unique artistic practices, engage a wide audience and increase the access to and understanding of image-based practices. Gallery 44 supports over 400 artist members through affordable access to analogue and digital facilities and various professional development opportunities, including conceptual and technical workshops, portfolio reviews and mentorships. Gallery 44 continues to serve an important role in the larger arts community by supporting: · emerging artists through such annual programs as Proof, OUTREACH, Darkroom Club, CameraLinks and CameraReach · Canadian and international artists and curators through dynamic exhibitions and residencies · diverse audiences through public programs such as talks, tours, discussions, screenings, writing groups and performances · writers in every stage of their careers through our vital and prolific publishing program",gallery centered programming areas offer affordable production facilities artist members including darkrooms digital printing ensuring artists working diverse media accessible space experiment develop photo based practices providing similarly accessible gallery space g44 presents dynamic exhibitions reflect range contemporary issues visual forms mentor focused institution curator focused maintain collaborative approach artists play central active role shaping programming supporting artistic development g44 dedicates significant portions programming calendar focusing emerging artists longstanding programs proof cameralinks provide artists cusp explorations seeing widen dialogue contemporary photography equally important mandate provide production exhibition mentorship scholarship opportunities youth gta gallery outreach program example photography workshops youth underserved communities unique program inspires youth develop positive methods sharing stories initiate critical explorations art viewing art making artist centres canada providing ongoing hands arts education youth award winning education programs encourage greater visual literacy fostering generation artists gallery centre contemporary photography charitable non profit artist centre committed supporting multi faceted approaches photography lens based media founded 1979 establish supportive environment development artistic practice gallery mandate provide context meaningful reflection dialogue contemporary photography gallery committed programs reflect continuously changing definition photography presenting wide range practices engage timely critical explorations medium exhibitions public engagement education programs production facilities objective explore artistic cultural historic social political implications image expanding visual world gallery founded 1979 group artists need production facilities joined share darkroom studio space forming collective important step making facilities affordable creating supportive community artists common goals 1980 collective began mounting exhibitions 1981 began offering photography workshops gallery moved original location niagara street bathurst street 1986 production exhibition facilities expanded serve growing membership severe lack photographic education elementary secondary schools gallery began education schools program 1987 1994 gallery moved richmond improve centre exhibition production facilities widen audience centralized location main floor space currently includes administrative office main gallery adjacent vitrines gallery host seven annual exhibitions members gallery exclusively showcases work members gallery square foot accessible facilities basement include darkrooms shooting studio scanning lab wide format digital printing print finishing area resource library production gallery highlights works produced facilities history gallery prioritized equitable access breaking barriers arts artists audiences youth programming outside downtown core collaborating numerous community partners outside sector supporting artistic experimentation risk taking providing accessible public programs production support emerging practitioners diverse artists young people gta gallery partners include imaginenative images festival scotiabank contact photography festival toronto district school board ocad university trinity square video nia centre arts tangled art disability gallery continues develop evolve remained committed history artist centre relates fostering collaborative decision making sharing leadership roles retaining spirit artist centre members board staff work develop implement programs highlight unique artistic practices engage wide audience increase access understanding image based practices gallery supports artist members affordable access analogue digital facilities various professional development opportunities including conceptual technical workshops portfolio reviews mentorships gallery continues serve important role larger arts community supporting emerging artists annual programs proof outreach darkroom club cameralinks camerareach canadian international artists curators dynamic exhibitions residencies diverse audiences public programs talks tours discussions screenings writing groups performances writers stage careers vital prolific publishing program

"Espacio P is a benchmark among alternative spaces that are self-organised by artists in Madrid. Launched and directed by the multimedia artist, Pedro Garhel (Tenerife, 1952-2005), it developed collaborative dynamics of research, training and production. It also implemented the use of shared resources and means of diffusion that remained practically unexplored at that time in Spain.Its hybrid structure was the result of opening up and merging different artistic concepts and fields as well as crossing over and beyond the traditional limits of the exhibition space, the stage and the laboratory for research and production. Its aim was to explore the edges between the visual, performance and sound arts, so that different practices and languages were linked, through the sharing of a single space with multiple functions. Moreover, its programme was inclusive and socially engaging: it was a place where artists created community and art was synonymous with life and with shared experiences and knowledge.Between 1981 and 1997, Espacio P organised all kinds of activities related to performance, photography, installations, visual poetry, postal art, film, video and experimental music, as well as electronic and virtual reality art, at a time when the majority of art galleries and museums were celebrating the resurgence of painting.The remarkable trajectory of the activities of Espacio P is related to several thematic hubs: do-it-yourself culture between fluxus and punk; action art and audiovisual language; the gender question; interventions in the public space; and the transition from the analog era to digital culture. Overall, it aimed to focus attention on artistic practices which were facing up to the challenges of the globalisation of culture, of production and of the markets. In addition, those practices tackled alternatives to the impact of media power by the construction of new spaces as well as individual and collective identities in a period of transition towards the post-industrial society. Space P is one of the pioneer initiatives of artistic self-management in Spain. Located in the center of Madrid between 1981 and 1997, he set up new training and production models, and introduced methods to manage resources and collaborations that have not been explored until then in this country. Space P was one of the first Spanish alternative spaces, active between 1981 and 1997. The “P” resulted in “performance” as well as “polival” as well as “political”.

"In 2015, in collaboration with Markus Lichti, we created an exhibition space called Rinomina (in Italian renamed, re-named). We founded this place with the objective of giving shape to our own artistic practice here in Paris, but most of all, to give other artists the opportunity to create exhibitions there. The name ‘Rinomina’ comes from the Italian expression for renaming a file on a computer. It is a transitive verb {consists of ‘re’ and ‘name’} and means to name again, to rename or to change a name ; in particular, in the IT world, assign a file or document a different title from the previous one. The fascinating possibility of literally renaming everything is one of the main inspiration for this exhibition space.Rinomina conceives its programming and curatorial practice as strongly rooted in our own artistic activity. Since its creation, this space has exhibited many artists from the contemporary French and international scene, in a heterogeneous and dynamic program, such as: Felicia Atkinson, Louise Drulhe, Raphaël Bastide, Cécile Bicler, Eric Giraudet de Boudemange, Vanessa Dziuba, Martin Chramosta, Victoire Barbot, Jean-Philippe Breitin, Noemie Vulpian, Dominique Koch, Ambra Pittoni, Thomas Geiger, Claudia de La Torre Ana Navas and many others. Rinomina tries to act coherently in a flexible, conceptual and collaborative process, aiming to maintain a divergent perspective on what an exhibition space can be.About the founderDaniela Baldelli was born 1977 in Asmara, Eritrea.

"It functions as a multidimensional space, organizing and undertaking the production of multifaceted events from the world of theatre, music, dance, cinema, visual arts, letters and sciences. At the same time, its multipurpose spaces are available to individuals, organizations and other agencies for the hosting of events, presentations, seminars, symposia, conferences and scientific or other workshops. The House of Culture and Research is an organization that specializes in four pillars: contemporary arts, science, innovation and social impact. It is a natural evolution of the Artos Foundation which, for 21 years (2000-2021), has contributed to local and European culture in the fields of cultural research, creativity, science and social impact.It offers a platform for scientists, artists, artists and creatives to participate in cultural and international research. Artos House is engaged and stimulates the social challenges of contemporary research, creativity and research. The ARTos Cultural and Research Foundation was founded by the artists Achilleas Kentonis and Maria Papacharalambous. It is a contemporary arts and science center dedicated to research and creativity: two magical worlds of adventure and discovery, encompassing sojourns into the fields of learning, chaos and imagination. Its premises, both transcendental and material, inspire the contemporary artist/creator and the scientist/creator alike, offering to both a platform, promoting them at a local as well as at an international level, with quality being the main criterion.The Foundation is housed in premises which once hosted the bakeries of Nicosia’s Agii Omologites parish, hence the inspiration for its name: “artos” or “bread”, the product of the bakeries, a staple dietary item for the people of Cyprus through the ages; at the same time, there’s “ARTos” (ARTs Operating System), which places us directly in the modern era of the apotheosis of Technology which, incidentally, we should never forget, etymologically means “the systematic treatment of an art”, and tha Art, according to Zenios, “…is the Bread (artos) which gladdens the soul”! The very premises themselves constitute another unique experience to the visitor. The traditional architecture of the 1901 building converses with the industrial edifice of 1950 which once housed the bakeries, while at the same time we see incorporated into the entire complex a modern extension completed in 2003, thus creating an autonomous work of art marked by artful plasticity and rhythm. One could say that this is a space inspiring and challenging creativity, a situation, in any case, constituting that which is desired. Furthermore, during the refurbishment process and by opportune coincidence, we discovered and reconstructed a complex comprising nine unique ancient tombs dating back to the Hellenistic or, according to others, archaic period. In this way, the Foundation, with a solid foothold in the past, has, at the same time, its sights turned towards the future; it is inspired by ancient art and, through the use of modern technology, serves Cyprus’ timeless civilization, providing a platform for artistic and scientific creativity on a local and at the same time international level.",functions multidimensional space organizing undertaking production multifaceted events world theatre music dance cinema visual arts letters sciences multipurpose spaces available individuals organizations agencies hosting events presentations seminars symposia conferences scientific workshops house culture research organization specializes pillars contemporary arts science innovation social impact natural evolution artos foundation years 2000 2021 contributed local european culture fields cultural research creativity science social impact platform scientists artists artists creatives participate cultural international research artos house engaged stimulates social challenges contemporary research creativity research artos cultural research foundation founded artists achilleas kentonis maria papacharalambous contemporary arts science center dedicated research creativity magical worlds adventure discovery encompassing sojourns fields learning chaos imagination premises transcendental material inspire contemporary artist creator scientist creator alike offering platform promoting local international level quality main criterion foundation housed premises hosted bakeries nicosia agii omologites parish inspiration artos bread product bakeries staple dietary item people cyprus ages artos arts operating places directly modern era apotheosis technology incidentally forget etymologically means systematic treatment art tha art according zenios bread artos gladdens soul premises constitute unique experience visitor traditional architecture 1901 building converses industrial edifice 1950 housed bakeries incorporated entire complex modern extension completed 2003 creating autonomous work art marked artful plasticity rhythm say space inspiring challenging creativity situation case constituting desired furthermore refurbishment process opportune coincidence discovered reconstructed complex comprising unique ancient tombs dating hellenistic according archaic period way foundation solid foothold past sights turned future inspired ancient art use modern technology serves cyprus timeless civilization providing platform artistic scientific creativity local international level
"Pamela is not a collective, Pamela is an artistic cooperative. Pamela is active in combining material and intangible resources to the service of the artists of its territory and beyond. Pamela is a tool for continuous use that thinks of the artist's situation today to invent tomorrow's practices. Pamela is a platform to meet between the different actors and public of the art world. Pamela is a counterpoint. Pamela is a field of aesthetic, political, economic and social experimentation to question more than it can and must be done today. Pamela is a point on the map. Since the beginning of Pamela's creation, we are aware of the fact that the collective term, often attributed to this type of project, is not used to our subject to prefer the cooperative. This term seems to be more appropriate to define what we like, namely the combination of material and material resources in a project for its members and artists with which we choose to work on the principle of the art-run space as a place of thought and by artists. It seems important to us in a middle of the art that remains very vertical in its functions to create a place that we like. This term appears to be more appropriate to define what we like, namely, that is the common set of material and material resources in a project for its members. This is the setting up of a common set of material and material resources for its members. This is the setting of the structure of its members and its artists with which we choose to work. It is the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure. We do not think that Pamela is a work to be spoken by itself but may be considered to be a work under the conditions and contexts where she operates her actions. As mentioned above, Pamela does not think of herself as a collective but as a tool for the service of artists who create it outside of any plastic community. Pamela is a variable geometry tool whose uses are re-invented according to the proposals of the artists who invest it. If Pamela does not think of it as a work as a priority, it is possible that in the future a first period of activity could work at this moment, at the same time, at the same time, at the same time, and at the same time perform the work of the artist.",pamela collective pamela artistic cooperative pamela active combining material intangible resources service artists territory pamela tool continuous use thinks artist situation today invent tomorrow practices pamela platform meet different actors public art world pamela counterpoint pamela field aesthetic political economic social experimentation question today pamela map beginning pamela creation aware fact collective term attributed type project used subject prefer cooperative term appropriate define like combination material material resources project members artists choose work principle art space thought artists important middle art remains vertical functions create like term appears appropriate define like common set material material resources project members setting common set material material resources members setting structure members artists choose work structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure structure think pamela work spoken considered work conditions contexts operates actions mentioned pamela does think collective tool service artists create outside plastic community pamela variable geometry tool uses invented according proposals artists invest pamela does think work priority possible future period activity work moment perform work artist
"EXPOSITIONS: Since 2002 the Gallarie Octave Cowbell develops its cultural inscription within the Great East by means of a diffusion of the contemporary artistic scene. It is through exhibitions, rhythms by various actions of mediation and meetings, which the gallery offers a unique artistic direction. This last season is oriented around reflections on nature, on the human report to the environment, on the proximity of territories but also around the transmission and mutualization of knowledge. EDITIONS OF ARTS: Since 2011, the gallery accompanies each exhibition by the creation of multiple artists. As for example, the paintings and drawings of the paintings of the artists, the paintings and drawings of the paintings are based on the drawings. Octave Cowbell is a historical and emblematic association of the Great East Region that has been committed since 2002 to support and disseminate the young contemporary creation in all its forms. More than a space of creation, exhibition and residence, Octave Cowbell is a place to meet and exchange. The thinking of the gallery is about nature, the human report to the environment, the proximity of the territories and the perception of the cosmos. The experiences of artists are privileged. After 20 years in the 5th Street of Parmentiers, the gallery where ""we are between the window"", lives a new chapter in a single-town area of the Canyon of the Canyon.

"ETAJ is an artist-run space that was established in 2018. It serves as a catalyst, focusing on enhancing the effectiveness of contemporary artistic creations within the local context. A group of artists came together to form this cultural cell, aiming to address the needs of emerging artists and provide them with alternative solutions for showcasing and presenting their work to the public. It embraces an eclectic and spontaneous aesthetic approach, often delving into experimental territory. However, it also incorporates specific organizational elements, such as the in situ nature of the exhibited works, designed and showcased by the featured artists. By emphasizing contextual and site-specific aspects, ETAJ aims to create a unique experience for both artists and audiences. This initiative strives to increase the visibility of emerging artists, supporting their creative endeavours and fostering an environment where their innovative works can be discovered and appreciated. Since its foundation in 2018, by nine graduates in the art of Bucharest and Cluj, ETAJ has been transformed into a flowering cultural cell for the local artistic community. ETAJ welcomes a wide range of artists, emerging and established personalities, students, university students and influenced personalities of the Romanian art scene. One of the main objectives of the ETAJ is to provide a platform for artists to present their work, promoting dialogue and collaboration between designers and designers.",etaj artist space established 2018 serves catalyst focusing enhancing effectiveness contemporary artistic creations local context group artists came form cultural cell aiming address needs emerging artists provide alternative solutions showcasing presenting work public embraces eclectic spontaneous aesthetic approach delving experimental territory incorporates specific organizational elements situ nature exhibited works designed showcased featured artists emphasizing contextual specific aspects etaj aims create unique experience artists audiences initiative strives increase visibility emerging artists supporting creative endeavours fostering environment innovative works discovered appreciated foundation 2018 graduates art bucharest cluj etaj transformed flowering cultural cell local artistic community etaj welcomes wide range artists emerging established personalities students university students influenced personalities romanian art scene main objectives etaj provide platform artists present work promoting dialogue collaboration designers designers
"The context of art in Japan is different from the European context to have a much weaker field of knowledge of art and a more dynamic internal art market. Since then, institutions do not have the first role in establishing the definition of art and performing aesthetic judgment. The museums do not really have autonomy and exhibitions are mostly the result of private projects of the world's media or sometimes local politics. Japanese artists are used to pay for the existence of public. For contemporary art artists, the recommended strategy is to be recognized as a national artist who is not a nationalist. We do not think that the space of the ""Palais des Paris"" is a work. Our aim was to produce an articulation between the design of an artist producing an object and a local Japanese audience on the one hand. This art is a work of dialogue with the artist, contextualization and translation to the public in order to reach an understanding without interest. If we can consider our work as a ""work"", then it results in less space than the art of the language. The film from a residency can then also be considered as ""work"", it is by means of an image-text article based on this type of media.",context art japan different european context weaker field knowledge art dynamic internal art market institutions role establishing definition art performing aesthetic judgment museums really autonomy exhibitions result private projects world media local politics japanese artists used pay existence public contemporary art artists recommended strategy recognized national artist nationalist think space palais CITY work aim produce articulation design artist producing object local japanese audience hand art work dialogue artist contextualization translation public order reach understanding consider work work results space art language film residency considered work means image text article based type media
"In history, Glasbox was conceived to respond to a particular need, that of the distribution of artists to the beautiful art of Paris. These artists are looking for spaces to show their work which are neither institutions nor commercial spaces, they do not want to be emancipated but also because these spaces are difficult to access new practices, without great visibility. Glassbox's programming remains in this interview, allowing great freedom of programming and choice of choice, creating an alternative to art centres or other structures that are more impermissible to search, to the wrong way, to the wrong way, or to put it to the wrong place. I do not think that space or function can be considered as a work, in the sense that its vocation is to welcome or make it germinate again. It is not only an empty box in which we would have something without any impact on this thing but a little like a machine, composed of places, tools, people who pass it, which affects the work that is placed in it. However, I think that in our practice in this space, methods can be similar to those of artists during creation: experimenting with formats, looking at things done and analysing them, modifying them in one sense or another by using them in one way or another by using them.",history glasbox conceived respond particular need distribution artists beautiful art CITY artists looking spaces work institutions commercial spaces want emancipated spaces difficult access practices great visibility glassbox programming remains interview allowing great freedom programming choice choice creating alternative art centres structures impermissible search wrong way wrong way wrong think space function considered work sense vocation welcome make germinate box impact thing little like machine composed places tools people pass affects work placed think practice space methods similar artists creation experimenting formats looking things analysing modifying sense using way using
