Immanence,"Immania was created in 1998 at a time when many artists appeared. These exhibition sites were also a response to a particular situation. The context of the period is: The financial crisis in France will see the expansion of the market of art, starting in the first years of this century. The artists are no longer able to expose themselves in the galleries after the others. They will create their own structures of art. They are more complex and the financial crisis is not only false, they are added to the generation crisis in the world of art. This is not because a place is created and managed by one or more artists that this place is a work. It is even a counter-sensitivity. Artists who open and manage exhibition sites are curators. They have a double activity. They have an artistic activity and a curatorial activity. Sometimes these two activities are believed. The question that can be asked is: Is artistic activity able to influence curatorial and inverse activity? Sometimes it can happen that the artistic work of a curator is closely related to one or more organized exhibitions. Sometimes artistic practice is far from curative practice."

Lieu d'exposition en voie de déplacement (LEVD),"Born in 2014 of the initiative of two plastic artists, Mahé de Rosière and Dimitri Kiosseff, the place of exhibition on the way of movement (LEVD) is an association structure designed as a means to design production and dissemination frameworks for contemporary art regardless of cultural institutions, galleries or systems of residence. ""For artists, for artists"" could be the word of order. The place of exhibition on the way of movement is a simple direction: to find places, space for exhibitions, to perform a series of short events, during which the artists are invited. In order to enrich each project led by the cultural institutions, galleries or systems of residence. The LEVD is investing in a new place, temporary exhibition space, for each exhibition cycle. The association is located in Lyon for its first project and aims to highlight the emerging artistic scene by bringing artists from four corners of France together.

Artpool,"The roots of Artpool go back to the Chapel Exhibitions held in artist György Galántai's ""summer studio"", the Balatonboglár Chapel, from 1970 to 1973. By the time the police closed it down in August of that year, the Balatonboglár studio had established itself as the center of officially proscribed avant-garde art, and in retrospect, one of the cradles of cultural change in Hungary._x000D_ Six years later, in 1979, György Galántai and Júlia Klaniczay made another attempt to create an alternative art institute, one that would make room for the new trends in art. They established Artpool at a time when art forms out of keeping with the official cultural policy were denied access to the public. Periodically banned, but on the whole tolerated, Artpool organized manyexhibitions and art events, and published several anthologies and art catalogues between 1979 and 1990. From 1983 to 1985, they put out eleven ""illegal"" issues of ""Aktuális Levél"" (Artpool Letter), a ""samizdat"" art magazine which continues to serve as the sole documentary source on the non-official art of those years._x000D_ Artpool's aim was to provide contemporary Hungarian artists with information and potential contacts on the international art scene, as well as to publicize and document the activities of Hungarian artists out of favor with those who dictated the cultural policy of the time. Collecting what documents were extant on the alternative art of the `60s, `70s and `80s, Artpool set up an archivewhich, they hoped, would provide future generations with ammunition and inspiration when it came to moral stands and artistic struggles of their own._x000D_ In the ten years of its ""illegal"" existence, the archive accumulated several rarecollections of international significance._x000D_ Subsequent to the political changes of 1989, Artpool, which already had an international reputation, was officially recognized, and was open to the public._x000D_ The Artpool Art Research Center has been operating with funding from the Budapest Municipal Council since 1992. 1979: ARTPOOL'S PERIODIC SPACE (APS), Periodic Art Space (""what is periodic is constant"" /Galántai).

GERTRUDE CONTEMPORARY,"Gertrude Contemporary presents approximately 20 exhibitions annually featuring work by Australian and international artists across three gallery spaces with a focus on new work, commissions and expanded practice. Running alongside our Exhibition Program is the Gertrude Contemporary Studio Program, which consists of sixteen non-residential studios, available to artists in the first fifteen years of their professional practice and provided for two-year tenures. Gertrude Contemporary also has a residential studio for visiting international artists, curators and writers for residencies of between two-weeks to three-months, as well as producing several international touring exhibitions per year. We also offer a world class Education Program, Volunteer and Internship Programs, Gertrude’s Table Patrons Program, annual Gertrude Editions as well as an active publishing program. Gertrude Contemporary is valued nationally and respected internationally as a dynamic centre for the production and presentation of contemporary art. With the artist placed firmly at the centre of our community, we foster a culture of risk, collaboration and critical-thinking to generate innovative programs that engage audiences in creative exchange. Gertrude Contemporary opened in 1985 in a large converted warehouse in Fitzroy, Melbourne and led the way as Australia’s first combined gallery and studio complex. Named initially after its address - 200 Gertrude Street - the organisation has since expanded, transforming from an address to an entity, and changing its name to Gertrude Contemporary in 2010. _x000D_ Since 1985 we have accumulated a vast alumni of past exhibiting and studio artists including some of Australia’s leading names in contemporary art. In fact every artist who has represented Australia at the Venice Biennial since 1999 has either held a studio or participated in an exhibition at Gertrude Contemporary. This select community of Australia’s most pivotal contemporary artists has expanded in recent years to include our increasing international presence, with leading artists and curators from all over the world exhibiting in our galleries and staying in our studios. As a key generator for ideas in Australia, and with the momentum of our history behind us, Gertrude Contemporary is now the oldest, continually running contemporary art centre in Australia."

Le générateur,"The generator is an intermediate, hybrid, interstitial space for life to be maintained and developed in this area if it is particularly around Paris called the peripheral. The generator, place of incubation (speed) and catalyse (very neutral), is an invitation to a journey without a fixed destination, without the default goal of expanding the universe's existence possibilities. Innovated in 2006, free and independent, The Generator is an area of 600 m2 located on the Paris list 13th. Deliberately open and minimal in its configuration, The Generator is dedicated to all contemporary expressions, especially performance and plastic arts. The Generator gives priority to the productions of atypical artistic formats (temporality, geography, content) and remains open to all forms of multidisciplinary experimentation. The Generator is a space managed by artists for which the fact of being an artist is a way of life, a way of not giving up on life, a way of looking for other strategies of existence, a way of producing meetings where each one remains a free and respectful subject of its subjectivity."
TCB,"TCB art inc. is a space run by artists based in Melbourne, Australia, dedicated to providing a space where young, emerging and established artists alike have the artistic freedom to explore, experiment and take risks within their practices. The gallery was established in 1998 by artists Blair Trethowan, Sharon Goodwin and Thomas Deverall, who identified a vital position for a non-commercial, non-profit space in Melbourne’s CBD that exposed the work of young and emerging artists to a wide and disparate audience. What has developed is a lo-fi, high-energy project with ambitious aims, offering support and assistance to young and emerging artists at a very “grass roots” level and facilitating ongoing dialogue between them and the broader art and non-art communities. During its 16 years of operation, TCB has supported and developed the careers of over 600 young and emerging artists from Australia and the Asia-Pacific Region, many of whom presented their first solo exhibition at the gallery._x000D_ In 2001 TCB moved from its original home in the Port Philip Arcade into Waratah Place off Chinatown. This space was shared with Uplands Gallery, and a unique relationship developed, which saw an artist run initiative working successfully along side a commercial gallery. This relationship has further consolidated TCB’s position within the community, enabling us to reach a much broader audience and gain invaluable experience in running the gallery. This model was further beneficial in giving many younger artists the opportunity to work and exhibit alongside more established and experienced artists, offering valuable experience and ensuring them a broader audience._x000D_ In August 2006, Uplands Gallery relocated to Prahran, leaving TCB with the opportunity to occupy and run the entire space at Waratah Place. The gallery more than doubled in physical size, allowing for the provision of more exhibition allotments as well as the opportunity to undertake larger scale and more ambitious projects to broaden the scope of the gallery. This growth and regained autonomy has allowed TCB to cement its place as one of Melbourne’s leading independent artist run spaces."

West Space,"West Space Projects are programmed to run alongside our application-based program and provide support to artist-initiated/ developed exhibitions, publications, sound releases, performances, international exchanges and forums._x000D_ These ambitious projects negotiate innovative approaches to cultural debate, production, presentation, collaboration and exchange. They extend across artforms and into non-arts areas. The West Space Projects Program enables West Space to actively generate, contribute to and support quality cultural development, alongside performing the more usual artist-run-space role of presenting an application-based exhibition program. West Space was established in 1993 in Footscray by Brett Jones and Sarah Stubbs and was, at the time, one of the few artist-run initiatives to present a critically engaged, multi-art form program accessible to practitioners through peer-assessed applications._x000D_ The organisation quickly grew in stature and reputation, moving premises in 2000 with the assistance of the City of Melbourne to a location in Anthony Street, between RMIT University and the Queen Victoria Market._x000D_ In 2011 West Space began an exciting new chapter, moving to our much larger and centrally located current site, at Level 1 of the City of Melbourne owned building City Village at 225 Bourke Street. This substantially greater size has enabled us to radically expand our artistic program, offering more opportunities for audiences to engage with innovative arts events in the heart of Melbourne._x000D_ West Space has developed a significant reputation amongst Australian and international arts organisations. This has been forged through a sustained belief in the importance of artist-run culture to practitioners, audiences and the art industry, and has manifested in a critically renowned exhibition program and a prolific range of self-generated projects and publications. Over the past 22 years West Space has exhibited over 2500 individual artists, produced 45 publications and a journal comprising 13 issues, and developed over 60 projects, including 10 international projects in Singapore, Milan, Vancouver, Toronto, Osaka, Seoul, Glasgow, Hong Kong, Oyama and Paris."

Some appears on our website, some has yet to be archived. For many reasons, now feels like the right time to consolidate, reflect upon and develop this material, both as a document and as an instigator of new projects._x000D_ Beyond memorialising past activities the idea of a ‘living archive’ that further propels Conical’s self-reflexive agenda is of interest and has an exciting potential to manifest in a variety of forms, recasting the Conical project._x000D_ Conical announces that our current exhibition is the final for thetime being._x000D_ After supporting spatial, temporal and conceptual practices in Melbourne since 2001 Conical will no longer operate an annual program of exhibitions.

L'impasse,"""Our goal is to invest live places to produce sense and shapes by organizing contemporary art exhibitions.The impasse, which is the name of our association, repeats the place's address and refers to the fragility of its situation. Also, our legitimacy is based on the fact that the place is missing, and on the idea that an empty place can and must open up a social or cultural activity. This space allows to expand the Paris art scene by making it visible the work of young artists who already constitute it by their activity and their reflection.The realization of the exhibitions follows two principles, the one of which is free of money, and that they are held free of charge, and their access to art is free of charge;"
l'Œil de Poisson,"The action of the Poisson ring refers to both the diffusion and the production of the current art. The centre prefers an art of research and exploration that encourages the decoupling of artistic practices and stimulates transfers or meetings between disciplines. It is to take account of the practices and problems that form the object of the current art and which redefinition it as nature, rather than support its definition. The mandate of the Poisson instrument is therefore to build its objectives through the implementation and production of different exhibitions, exchanges, events, and conferences. The Poison River has existed since 1985. It has been born motivated by the will of young artists to have production and dissemination facilities. During its foundation, the centre devoted itself only to photography. It has gradually expanded its dissemination activities and has worked actively to develop production facilities that are responsive to the diverse interests of its members. The Centre has thus extended its action to all visual arts as well as to the achievement of integrated or combined multidisciplinary events: dance, music, theatre, poetry._x000D_ Since 1995, the Poison Valley is a member of the Meduse cooperative and community of 10 communities."

Para Site,"Throughout its history, Para Site's activities have included a range of different formats, among which a smaller parallel exhibition space, Para/Site Central, hosted by Hanart TZ Gallery in Central (1997-2008); P/S magazine (1997-2006), a bilingual publication which was Hong Kong's first visual arts magazine and a central platform for the development of art writing and of a discursive scene in the city; and the Curatorial Training Programme (2007-2010). Since 2012, Para Site has been running an International Art Residency Programme. Para Site is Hong Kong's leading contemporary art centre and one of the oldest and most active independent art institutions in Asia. It produces exhibitions, publications and discursive projects aimed at forging a critical understanding of local and international phenomena in art and society. Founded in early 1996 as an artist run space, Para Site was Hong Kong's first institution of contemporary art and a crucial self-organised structure within the city’s civil society, during the uncertain period preceding its handover to Mainland China. Throughout the years, Para Site has evolved into a professional contemporary art centre, engaged in a wide array of activities and collaborations with other art institutions, museums, biennials and academic structures in Hong Kong and the international landscape. After the first year in Kennedy Town, Para Site relocated to Po Yan Street in Sheung Wan (at no. 2 in the initial years and at no. 4 until 2014). Para Site moved to North Point/Quarry Bay in early 2015. The institution has been led by Tobias Berger (2005-2008), Alvaro Rodriguez Fominaya (2008-2011) and Cosmin Costinas (since 2011)."

Studio Voltaire,"Studio Voltaire was initiated in 1994 by a collective of twelve artists who set up a studio space in a disused tram shed on Voltaire Road, Clapham. In1999 the organisation moved to its current location on Nelson’s Row, close to Clapham High Street and grew to become a registered charity in 2001. The move to a larger site enabled us to expand our provision of affordable studios and offer a dedicated gallery space in a Victorian former chapel, adjacent to the studios, both of which remain unique resources for the local area._x000D_ Our studios currently house over 45 London based artists, ranging from internationally recognised practitioners to recent graduates and includes two groups supporting artists with learning difficulties – Actionspace and Intoart. In recent years, the studios have also hosted a number of residencies for national and international artists; partners have included Berlin Senate, Collective Gallery, British Council, Outset and Royal College of Art._x000D_ Through an ambitious public programme of exhibitions, commissions, live events and offsite projects we play a key role in supporting emerging practices and ideas, often giving artists their first solo exhibition in London. We like to invest in the production of work by commissioning new projects that may not always be possible within institutional or commercial frameworks. Our programme is intergenerational, supporting emerging and underrepresented practices and allowing artists to develop new work on their own terms. This unique way of working allows us to develop long-term relationships with artists, often working together on multiple occasions._x000D_ Studio Voltaire’s gallery space is characterised by a dramatic vaulted ceiling and is flooded with natural light, providing a dynamic space to work in that is very unusual in London. Previous exhibited artists include Nairy Baghramian, Phyllida Barlow, Simon Bedwell, Juliette Blightman, Nicholas Byrne, Spartacus Chetwynd, Chris Evans, Thea Djordjadze, Liam Gillick, Anthea Hamilton, Emma Hedditch, Intoart, Goshka Macuga, Dawn Mellor, Henrik Olesen, Elizabeth Price, Jo Spence, Joanne Tatham & Tom O’Sullivan, Donald Urquhart, Lawrence Weiner and Cathy Wilkes._x000D_ We are committed to widening participation from individuals and groups who may not typically access contemporary art. Since 2002 Studio Voltaire has been running wide reaching education projects and in 2011 we initiated Not Our Class,a unique programme of participation and research based within a community and contemporary art context._x000D_ 2014 marked 20 years of Studio Voltaire supporting artists. In this time we have grown from a local artist collective to receive regular funding from Arts Council England as a sign of best practice. We continue to generate the majority of our core income independently via studio rents, commercial hires and trading. Our strengths and ambitions have grown over the years and we are proud of our unique way of working, which remains close to the creative process at a grassroots level and places great emphasis on risk-taking. By placing the artist at the centre of everything we do we aim to continue to develop our programmes to engage with wider audiences into the future."
White Columns,"White Columns presents an ongoing program of exhibitions, projects, talks, screenings, and events. It is a not-for-profit gallery which is open to the public, free-of-charge. White Columns is New York's oldest alternative art space. It was founded in 1970 by Jeffrey Lew and Gordon Matta-Clark as an experimental platform for artists. Originally located in SoHo (and known as the 112 Workshop/112 Greene Street), the organization was renamed White Columns when it moved to Spring Street in 1979. In 1991 White Columns moved to Christopher Street in the West Village, and in 1998 the gallery relocated to its present address on the border of the West Village and Meat Packing District.

It endeavors to establish an open space for artists to mature at their own pace, and to provide an environment conducive for artists to experiment, experience and exchange ideas. The Artists Village (TAV) is a contemporary art group in Singapore. Founded by contemporary artist Tang Da Wu in 1988 at 61-B Lorong Gambas in Sembawang.

The Artist Village was Singapore's first artist colony, which enables artists to explore radical new ways and ideologies in making art that is in synch with the societal changes and state affairs in the late 1980's. From 1989 onwards, the village came alive with avant-garde performances and art exhibitions with 7 art shows that year. At the height of the village history, The Artist Village housed 35 artists with 50 other artists participating in other art activities organised by the village. In 1990, The Artist Village organised a 24-hour art event called The Time Show. It brought together artists working in all forms of multimedia in one art show. Sadly that same year, the village's land was repossessed by the Singapore Government for urban development."

ARTos,"It functions as a multidimensional space, organizing and undertaking the production of multifaceted events from the world of theatre, music, dance, cinema, visual arts, letters and sciences. At the same time, its multipurpose spaces are available to individuals, organizations and other agencies for the hosting of events, presentations, seminars, symposia, conferences and scientific or other workshops. The ARTos Cultural and Research Foundation was founded by the artists Achilleas Kentonis and Maria Papacharalambous. It is a contemporary arts and science center dedicated to research and creativity: two magical worlds of adventure and discovery, encompassing sojourns into the fields of learning, chaos and imagination. Its premises, both transcendental and material, inspire the contemporary artist/creator and the scientist/creator alike, offering to both a platform, promoting them at a local as well as at an international level, with quality being the main criterion._x000D_ The Foundation is housed in premises which once hosted the bakeries of Nicosia’s Agii Omologites parish, hence the inspiration for its name: “artos” or “bread”, the product of the bakeries, a staple dietary item for the people of Cyprus through the ages; at the same time, there’s “ARTos” (ARTs Operating System), which places us directly in the modern era of the apotheosis of Technology which, incidentally, we should never forget, etymologically means “the systematic treatment of an art”, and tha Art, according to Zenios, “…is the Bread (artos) which gladdens the soul”!_x000D_ The very premises themselves constitute another unique experience to the visitor. The traditional architecture of the 1901 building converses with the industrial edifice of 1950 which once housed the bakeries, while at the same time we see incorporated into the entire complex a modern extension completed in 2003, thus creating an autonomous work of art marked by artful plasticity and rhythm. One could say that this is a space inspiring and challenging creativity, a situation, in any case, constituting that which is desired._x000D_ Furthermore, during the refurbishment process and by opportune coincidence, we discovered and reconstructed a complex comprising nine unique ancient tombs dating back to the Hellenistic or, according to others, archaic period. In this way, the Foundation, with a solid foothold in the past, has, at the same time, its sights turned towards the future; it is inspired by ancient art and, through the use of modern technology, serves Cyprus’ timeless civilization, providing a platform for artistic and scientific creativity on a local and at the same time international level._x000D_"

Live Club Ssam (SSamzie Space),"PROGRAMGALLERIES (1F, 2F, 3F)The three galleries of SSamzie Space regularly hold six to eight exhibitions, curated to meet the characteristics of each gallery. The annual project exhibitions, which form the main frame of the exhibition programs, are: ""The Emerging"": the simultaneous solo exhibitions of three young emerging artists.""Pick & Pick"": one leading artist, 'picked' by SSamzie Space 'picks' his junior artists and pupils to form a group exhibition.""Title Match"": the two-person exhibition for a dialogue and friendly rivalry between a 20th century avant-garde artist and a young futuristic artist of the 21st century. International exchange exhibition: the international group exhibition based on the shared experiences of mutual visits between Korean and foreign artists.Artist Studio (4F, 5F, 6F)The artist studios epitomize the character of SSamzie Space, different from ordinary galleries and museums. Each year, new artists are invited to the Studio Program and are then provided with studio space and supported for their creative endeavors. At the end of their one-year-long residency, artists hold ""The Open Studio"" exhibition to show the fruits of their artmaking and also to donate one of their works, which form the basis of the 'SSamzie Art Collection'. In 2001, the Studio Program was expanded to include foreign artists and project teams, which later evolved into the short-term residency program for foreign artists and overseas Korean artists. Each year an Australian artist is invited to the short-term program through Asialink and in 2005 the exchange studio program between the international artist-in-residency programs will begin.THE MEDIA THEATER ""Baram (Wind)"" (2F)Concerts by underground rock bands are mainstays for the evenings and occasionally, art performances, avant-garde films, and media art festivals are hold here as well, with which ""Baram"" has been recognized as an alternative space and has attracted attention from the mass media. All concerts and performances are programmed by ""Ssamnet"" which casts on Internet broadcasting network of ""SSamzie"". At the same time, ""Ssamnet"" has also become devoted to selecting new artists, marketing, planning concerts, and producing albums._x000D_ Archive (5F)The archive is stocked with art books, journals, catalogues, videos, and portfolios of progressive young artists. Once all preparations are ready, the archive will be open to the public via a membership program. It is expected that this archive can serve as an information and reference center for new generation art. SSamzie Space, sponsored and operated by SSamzie Co. Ltd. (president Chun Ho-kyun), opened in June 2000 as a composite-culture space to promote cutting-edge art in Korea. It is located in the area of Hong-ik University, which is the hotbed of art production and consumption in Seoul and also the main gathering spot for artists. SSamzie Space, which has become an incubator for new generation art, is linked to and is an extension of the SSamzie Art Project launched in March 1998. SSamzie Space's three galleries, namely, the Main Gallery (3F), Project Gallery (2F), and Garage Gallery(1F) and the Media Theater ""Baram""(2F) together make up the activity space presenting on a regular basis various exhibitions, performances, concerts and events. The art studios located on the 4th to 6th floors are the creative spaces of the young artists. The 5th floor, the main office as well as an archive, is provided with art books, journals, catalogues, videos, and artist portfolios. SSAMZIE ART PROJECTSSamzie launched the 'SSamzie Art Project' to support and sponsor artists during the unprecedented financial crisis of the IMF in 1998. Although SSamzie had previously established a background of art based product designs, performances from comprehensive fashion shows, art prints, art advertisements, art books, and various cultural event sponsorships, this marked a new peak of SSamzie's art support. Through art studios, overseas exhibition promotion, and Gallery Hyundai exhibition programs, the 'SSamzie Art Project' has become the bedrock for the creativity of young avant-garde artists. Moreover, the range of the project has reached experimental and progressive art genres, including, among others, underground music, progressive dance, and independent films."

General Public,
G39,"G39 is an artist-run gallery in the centre of Cardiff, Wales’ capital city. The organisation recently relocated from a narrow three storey building where it originated, to an expansive warehouse. Here you can see a wide-ranging programme from major exhibitions and formal symposia to experimental projects and intimate events. In addition to the gallery programme, g39 also works in offsite locations for individual projects. The organisation also runs Wales Artist Resource Programme – WARP - an open-access resource and training space for artists. G39 focuses on contemporary work and consciously programmes a mix of work from Wales with work from further afield, placing work by established names alongside work by emerging or lesser known artists. The focus is on experimentation and risk and g39 aims to provide the opportunities to showcase new work rather than relying on selling. The organisation exists with the generous support of the Arts Council Of Wales and in 2004 it became the first artist-run space in Wales to be supported by a revenue agreement with ACW. In 2008 g39 was recognised as a Beacon company, an award that aims to ‘enable those companies and organisations which consistently create work of high quality and achieve levels of excellence to develop’. The Arts Council currently provide around 60% of the organisation's total costs and the remainder is provided through different trusts and organisations and, crucially, the input of a number of volunteers on the project. Between 2008 and 2011 the WARP programme was generously supported by the Esmée Fairbairn Foundation. G39 was established in 1998 and incorporated in 2000; it is an artist run organisation in the heart of Cardiff and is part gallery, part community and part resource. Founded by artists Chris Brown and Anthony Shapland and supported by numerous artists over its lifetime, it has organised exhibitions both in the permanent ‘white cube’ space in Cardiff city centre as well as using offsite temporary venues including digital display boards, billboards, shipping containers, warehouses and empty shop units. The project started in the upstairs, disused rooms of a former travel agent on Mill Lane. Shapland, who grew up in Bargoed, lived in the space after returning from studies to Wales in the mid-nineties renting the top floor, a run-down flat with no shower (the nearby Empire Pool providing showers). This eventually became a studio space as well as basic accommodation. Having worked at The Tannery, an artist run space in London, Shapland was keen to see what could be done in Wales and realised the potential for the city centre space as a showing space for other artists. At that time he was involved in delivering an artists project for Ffotogallery with another artist, Chris Brown. Brown had arrived in Wales to start an MA in Newport and was equally keen to get involved in generating a project. There seemed to be a new interest in younger artists in Wales, running parallel with a new found confidence in Welsh music, film and literature. Around that time the Centre for Visual Arts was about to open, with a lot of hopes for its future,Jennie Savage was running SKIP, an art-zine that was bringing together artists and writers, the first Ffresh show atChapter (www.chapter.org) opened, curated by Karen MacKinnon, a cross section of new work being produced at that time in Wales and Show1, curated by John Hambley in a temporary space at Jacobs market followed a similar path. Hambley, a Fine Art graduate from Cardiff, went on to become an arts officer at the Arts Council Of Wales(www.artswales.org), and was instrumental in expanding the knowledge of artist run practice at the Council. The phenomenon of artist-initiated projects is by no means novel and the motivations and ambitions of different spaces are as varied as their output. The idea of providing independent or new ways of working acknowledges a certain ideological belief that the self-empowering nature of artist-run spaces could be used to shape culture. A willingness to be open to change, being flexible enough to adapt and respond to dominant political or cultural trends – whether for or against – has ensured that these spaces have maintained a key position in the mechanisms of the artworld. Shapland and Brown started working on the project together and an application was made to develop the idea of a showing space in Mill Lane. With the impermanence of the building in mind the two devised a naming system that would incorporate change; taking the g from gallery and the street number of whichever building the project moved to the project made the threat of change part of its being. It could be g39, g40, g101 but the formula stayed the same. Finally, with the support of the landlord of the time a period of rent-free use was negotiated in exchange for some renovation and a modest grant enabled work to start in 1997. Calling in favours from friends and family and developing links with artists that were keen to see the project develop the space was re-built, re-wired and re-plumbed on a shoestring. The first show, Pistol, opened in July 1998. Curatorially the show was a bit free-form but it signalled what was to become the ethos of the space – extending generosity and trust to artists to help them deliver their work to the highest standards possible, sustaining a mix of artists working in Wales while acting as a conduit for work from further afield; an open door policy with a focus on dialogue. And plenty of tea. After a year of project funding one of the ways g39 could continue was to apply for lottery funding. This involved a whole set of box-ticking, hoop-jumping and goalpost-shifting criteria and the application took up most of 1999. The process of making this application shaped the organisation, it had to have a board of trustees and to register as a company Ltd by guarantee, policies had to be written up and set in stone and a constitution and mission statement had to be drafted. Suddenly g39 became a more permanent and tangible thing, it had to shape itself as a project that answered lottery criteria that seemed to shift in the political breeze. Lottery was established to be an answerable and measurable way of distributing public money; it was necessarily predicated on quantity assessment, not quality and certainly not innovation or risk. During this time the largest lottery project in the city – the Centre for Visual Arts - closed its doors after just 14 months; the backlash against ACW lottery management of the project was considerable. G39's lottery funding was for a three-year period and the organisation had to exist in a permanent state of form filling and quarterly reports. Thankfully, this method of funding ended at midnight on the last day of the year in 2003. The relief of getting to the end of this period was short lived as three applications to ACW were refused and the organisation prepared to close its doors. The building was emptied, applications from artists were returned, it seemed that the project had come to a natural end. Recognising the impact this would have, arts officers Emma Geliot and Antony Owen-Hicks went back to the Council and developed an interim rescue package: one year later the space was taken on as a Revenue client, and has subsequently gained Beacon status. By virtue of surviving this long the space may have become part of the establishment, but its history of flexibility in times of crisis and sense of adaptability keeps the threat of bureaucracy, and the stagnation that comes with it, at bay. The space has grown a few times in this history. Between Christmas and the New year in 1999 the space extended into the shop-space beneath and then to a linked room on the top floor which provided offices. In 2002 drilling started on the ground floor and a hatch cut through reinforced concrete into a previously unseen cellar space. It had been sealed in 1974 and had not been used since. This gave g39 increased storage and intermittent gallery space. Then in 2008 negotiations started with the shop next door to sub-let an extra space in the adjacent building. The project has gone from two small upstairs rooms to become four high (including the cellar) and two across. It now houses a gallery programme, a resource space for artists and an office. There is barely an inch of wasted space in the building and curating for a relatively awkward domestic sized space is always a challenge. Though the physical space is small – the size of a three-storey townhouse – its catchment is far larger, encompassing networks of artists, groups and galleries that the space is actively involved in. It is clear that their attention to this network, and a commitment to working with artists to present pioneering work in a clear and accessible manner, that has generated and sustained support from visitors and artists alike. G39 is active in curating projects internationally within other galleries and acts as an important showcase of work from Wales as well as a conduit for work from further afield. Shapland recently co-curated Flourish for the Moravska galleries (http://www.moravska-galerie.cz/en/) in the Czech republic with Marek Pokorny and Anima in Montreal with B312 (www.galerieb-312.qc.ca), both key landmark shows of work from Wales. The organisation sees its role as a ‘bridge’ between the artist, and the public, and a key component of the curatorial rationale is bringing contemporary work to new audiences. It provides a much-needed link in the Cardiff artscene as an independent intermediary space which has flexibility and sense of experimentation; something that larger, more established spaces cannot so readily maintain. Across the UK the development of the studios with showing space has been a model that has been used again and again, based on a socialist principle of working collectively for the good of everyone. In the past these spaces were seen as ‘alternative’ and loaded with ‘anti-establishment’ connotations, mirroring the indie music label ethos or ‘zine cultures. However, this dated version of a world with clear values drawn in black and white has been blurred. In the nineties many London artist-led projects were bankrolled by dealers and collectors who generated the self-fulfilling prophecy that they could gain kudos – and wealth – by assisting the emergence of the yBas. More recently many artist-run spaces have built themselves on more commercial models, in their structures and participation in art fairs, with certain artists taking the role of dealers and representing other artists. The boundaries between artists, curators, writers and dealers have never been so fluid. In Wales the pressures and motives have been different; in the absence of a prominent economic driver, artist-run activity has had to address other issues. The cultural factors of national identity, of a sense of being peripheral, and of the schisms caused by both language and geographic boundaries are omnipresent; though these are countered by a willingness to engage on an international level and the interesting tension in the pull forward of the contemporary and the pull back of tradition. Since the outset of the g39 project there has been a sense that curatorial strategy could address these issues; if the space was to play a key cultural role it first had to develop a strong relationship with artists in Wales while acting as a conduit for work from elsewhere. It was essential that this understanding was at its core. This has meant that g39 has been engaged in creating a sense of cohesion, evolving in parallel but in different ways than its metropolitan counterparts."
Gängeviertel ,"Seven years ago, on August 22, 2009, we came to Gängevirtel to save the disintegration and demolition and to create a living place in the centre of Hamburg. Tens of thousands of visitors from all over the world have been able to participate in exhibitions, concerts, festivals and lectures visited or discuss urban development.

POOL,"It has already been ten years that “art space pool”(former alternative space pool, hereinafter pool) has sustained itself as one of rare artists-run contemporary art spaces based in Seoul, Korea. As most of national art community, and some of international art community, may know, pool is a non-profit art organization initiated and founded collectively by artists, artists-curators and art critics back in 1999. Reflecting the historical enterprise pool has built so far for over a decade, 2010 pool starts its new chapter of an organizational career with a vision of “integrity amid openness.” pool is honored to inherit the historical legacy of autonomy and criticality voiced by artists themselves throughout the modern and contemporary art of Korea, and is responsible for sharing the legacy with a wider circle of cultural producers worldwide through more various programs and activities. From the last winter, pool and its newly appointed director have prepared for another big leap in the history of pool from a local art organization towards an art institution interconnecting busy flow between trans-local contemporary art scenes of today. Some of the most visible and distinct features of new 2010 pool are the change of its official name and of its physical space, which hopefully tells more open, yet strong manifestation of its institutional identity and agenda slightly in a different method and tone. The new name, “art space pool” indicates pool is still a platform for supporting art experimentations and producing new ideas, but not strictly serving for a registered notion of an alternative itself. 2010 pool rather attempts to diversify the kinds of alternative by developing various ways and modes of encounters, relationships and collaborations among cultural producers and the public. Pool respects its institutional identity as an artists-run organization and fosters the value of reality, action, utterance and institution of critique in contemporary art praxis. And the year 2010 is the time when pool re-launches itself for balanced dedication to its original mission and contemporary trans-regional trajectory of art practices today. The new space, new bilingual website, new international networks, new public programs, new institutional partnership programs and even new staffs of 2010 pool greet every one of you at the onset of 2010 season."
Transmission,"A diverse and increasingly high profile art scene has emerged in Glasgow with Transmission at its centre. Transmission provides a place where artists can meet, talk and exhibit along with local and international peers and influences._x000D_ Transmission was set up in 1983 by graduates from Glasgow School of Art who were dissatisfied with the lack of exhibition spaces and opportunities for young artists in Glasgow.

Compared to other galleries, artists and curators are able to carry out their exhibition program as a team throughout the year. It encourages active communication and involvement between curators and artists during the exhibition.

Gasworks,"Established in 1994, Gasworks is a contemporary art organisation based in South London, housing eleven artists' studios and offering a programme of exhibitions and events, artists’ residencies, international fellowships and educational projects. Seven studios are rented to London-based artists and four are reserved for the International Residency Programme for non-UK based artists. Gasworks hosts up to sixteen residencies a year, encouraging the exchange of ideas between international and local practitioners. The non-prescriptive and process-based nature of the residencies allows visiting artists to develop projects in response to their new context, or to conduct research benefiting from London’s resources. As a result, residencies generally culminate in an Open Studio. The residencies programme is also accompanied by activities such as talks and seminars, aiming to introduce the general public to international artists and their practice.The exhibition space accommodates four main projects a year, as well as a series of small-scale events. The programme includes solo and thematic exhibitions, screenings, workshops and seminars. Gasworks focuses on visual arts practice in its broadest sense, including design, documentary filmmaking and media art, amongst other areas of activity. These are all linked by a commitment to constantly reassess the position of artists within their wider cultural, social and political frameworks. _x000D_ The residencies and exhibitions programmes regularly cooperate, often to facilitate research and production for international artists invited to develop a project for the exhibitions and events programme. Gasworks runs a Participation programme which responds to, as well as operates independently from, the residencies and exhibitions. The programme aims to instigate dialogue and exchange through art, and to work with local groups and organisations to widen access to contemporary art._x000D_ Find out more about Gasworks and how we work with artists in this short film produced by Artquest:http://bit.ly/GasworksIntroGasworks is also part of Triangle Network, an international network of artists and organisations set up in 1982 whose activities include residencies and workshops.

Each year, through the Arts Council England’s International Artists Fellowship Programme, Gasworks organises residencies for six to eight UK-based artists in one of the Triangle partners' organisations, in countries including Cuba, China, South Africa, Kenya and India."
INTERIOR and the collectors,"We invite the public in a private space to show art in the intimate framework of an apartment that is not dedicated to the exhibition but to everyday life. Here, we become collectors and decide on the choice of artists, not by following a particular theme or problem, but by using a more personal logic that allows us to cross the genres and mix emerging artists with confirmed artists. The works presented are very diverse, conceptual, talented, surprising, sometimes violent. The private space allows a total freedom, a local exchange and densitying the foundations of a multicultural and sensitive art, another way of seeing an exhibition. INTERIOR and the collectors are an exhibition area led by two artists who opened with the 11th year of contemporary art of Lyon. This is not a conventional exhibition place but an apartment of character in a 16th-century building in the center of Lyon. It is also a more confidential space that can be praised for one or more nights. We want to develop temporary exhibitions in this typical place, more demanding than a personal and unique gallery."

With regard to the project ""+/- The Epicery"" or ""Donor-Donor"" the original will was clearly a position and a poetic response to the political will. The demonstration infrastructure and protocols implemented by them were voluntaryly fragile and did not want to be institutionalized, it was a response here and now in the social and artistic context of the age. In the 1990s, there was a gap between the historical and critical nature of Nicolas Bourriaud. There were no structures that welcomed the work of the young artists. They were also used to make their own tools. With regard to question 2 and for me, I voluntarily resell the concept of work by the author, and let the appreciation of others consider this work as ""work"". The archiving of a documentation, reflection on this subject, its replaying under the plastic, sound, film or still installation forms an integral part of my work. Tising bridges between curatorial and artistic practices has always been either, one that can serve as a narrative to the other. But the most important thing in this regard has always been to promote the spirit and intelligence of the collective, for which the story takes all its meaning and value of being a vecuist.

Western Front,"Established in 1973 the Western Front is one of Canada’s leading artist-run centres for contemporary art and new music. We produce and present visual art, exhibitions, new music concerts and workshops, media-art residencies, performance art and other artist-driven initiatives. The Western Front currently maintains programs in Exhibitions, Media Art and New Music, as well as an extensive archive of audio-visual materials. Through this diverse programming we continue to be a crucial platform for interdisciplinary, experimental art practices in Canada and internationally. The Western Front was founded in 1973 by eight artists (Martin Bartlett, Mo van Nostrand, Kate Craig, Henry Greenhow, Glenn Lewis, Eric Metcalfe, Michael Morris, Vincent Trasov) who wanted to create a space for the exploration and creation of new art forms. It quickly became a centre for poets, dancers, musicians and visual artists interested in exploration and interdisciplinary practices. As a focal point of experimental art practice through the 1970’s and 80’s, the Western Front, in connection with other centres like it, played a major role in the development of electronic and networked art forms in a national and international context._x000D_ Over its 43-year history the Western Front has promoted critical investigations into and surrounding interdisciplinary, media-based, anti-object, and ephemeral practices with particular attention to the contexts and economies in which art is produced. While general curatorial priorities have remained dedicated to these practices, the Western Front’s internal structure has continued to evolve and a number of distinct programs have been established and retired over the years including Performance Art, Movement Arts, Literary Arts and Front Magazine. The Western Front still continues to program events and exhibitions related to these genres, but no longer supports fully dedicated departments."

"Printed Matter, Inc.","Printed Matter is located in the heart of the busy Chelsea art district, surrounded by hundreds of galleries, arts organizations, and fellow arts non-profits. With with well over 100,000 visitors annually, the active street-level storefront offers a glimpse into the thriving state of contemporary artists’ publishing, featuring artists’ books, zines, posters, prints, multiples, audio works and a broad selection of out-of-print material. In addition to being packed full of unique publications, we host an array of programs and events on a regular basis. From rotating exhibitions and window installations toevents such as book launches, talks and performances, there's always something going on at Printed Matter. The shop also holds the non-profit offices where our small staff can be seen at work on various services in support of book artists and can always help you find what you’re looking for._x000D_ We are constantly checking in material, and have several hundred new titles available each month. So, visit often and see what new titles we have in stock! Founded in 1976, Printed Matter, Inc. is the world’s leading non-profit organization dedicated to the dissemination, understanding and appreciation of artists' books and related publications._x000D_ First established in Tribeca by Sol Lewitt and Lucy Lippard (among other important artists and art-workers) Printed Matter was developed in response to the growing interest in publications made by artists. Starting in the early 60s, many of the pioneering conceptual artists (as well as performance, process, environment, sound and other experimental media artists) began to explore the possibilities of the book form as an artistic medium. Large-edition and economically produced publications allowed experimentation with artworks that were democratically accessible, affordable, collaborative, and could circulate outside of the mainstream gallery system. Printed Matter provided a space that championed artists' books as complex and meaningful artworks, helping bring wider visibility to a medium that was not widely embraced at the time._x000D_ After 13 years on Lispenard Street in Tribeca, Printed Matter moved to a location on Wooster Street in SoHo. The spacious bookshop and large storefront windows allowed for book displays and artists’ installations, contributing to the vibrancy of a neighborhood that was undergoing rapid changes. In 2001 Printed Matter made its move to Chelsea, the center of New York’s art district, and further established its relationship to the contemporary arts. In 2005, we relocated to our current storefront on Tenth Avenue. The space has presented us once again with a street-level window and the opportunity to present exhibitions and programming. With the continuing growth of the organization, we manage to do a lot with the limited space we have, making every visit to Printed Matter new and exciting._x000D_ Over the years, Printed Matter has maintained a close relationship with the rich history of artists’ publications and continues to carry works from many of our organization's founding artists. Printed Matter’s first catalogue in 1976 included books from a number of artists who would turn out to be major figures of a generation – Kathy Acker, Laurie Anderson, Carl Andre, John Baldessari, Daniel Buren, Susan Hiller, Sol LeWitt, Adrian Piper, Ad Reinhardt, Martha Rosler, Edward Ruscha, and Lawrence Weiner to name a few– many of which are still available to purchase (though most no longer cost $2)._x000D_ Artists’ books have continued to provide a remarkable reflection on contemporary artistic practices. In recent years the community has witnessed an explosion of independently published projects, resulting in an increased and renewed interest in the field. As artists’ book publishing undergoes this tremendous renaissance, Printed Matter has expanded its services and activities to meet the needs of the field, notably including the establishment of our NY Art Book Fair in 2005 and the inaugural LA Art Book Fair in 2013. We’re thrilled to find that Printed Matter’s mission is more pertinent than ever._x000D_ In 2012 Printed Matter suffered from flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy, resulting in the loss of 9,000 books and considerable damage of our Archive. We are grateful for the tremendous support of the many individuals and foundations that helped us make steps towards a full recovery.

La Mamelle/Art Com,"La Mamelle / Art Com is a non-profit artist-run organization, active from 1975-1995. During this period, the organization was interested in alternative forms of making art, experimenting with form and material and questioning the definition and boundaries of art. The organization was involved in a multiplicity of activities including publishing, maintaining an artists’ space supporting performance art, exhibitions, video production and screenings, a library, distributing artist-produced works, and creating one of the first artists’ online networks._x000D_ Entretien de Judy Malloy avec Carl Eugene Loeffler : www.well.com/user/jmalloy/artcom.html Established in 1975, the first venture of the organization was in the realm of publishing. La Mamelle Magazine, v.1(1) was published in summer 1975. The organization then opened an 8,000 sf space in San Francisco at the beginning of 1976 as an alternative exhibition and performance space. From 1975 through the 1980s the organization supported live art, electronic media including video, artist-curated exhibitions, a bookstore with artists’ publications. It established and supported a growing repository of information about new art activities worldwide, and the first Video Art archive in northern California. In 1980, the organization began using the name Art Com, and supported programs that promoted the intersection of the arts and technology. It programmed video and audio works by artists on community access television and radio stations, cable TV and collaborated with other artists on video works and telecommunications projects. As publishers, the last issue in print format of Art Com Magazine (formerly La Mamelle, then Art Contemporary) was published in 1984 and became an e-journal in spring 1986 with the launching of the Art Com Electronic Network. ACEN was one of the first interactive online artists’ networks, conceived as a ’virtual village’ that focused on building a cultural environment and creating art through a global participatory process. From 1980 through the mid 1990s, the organization also ran Contemporary Arts Press Distribution and Art Com Media Distribution, an entrepreneurial effort to distribute artist-produced publications and media to libraries, bookstores, and television stations worldwide."

Zona,"Founded in 1974 in Florence, Zona represents an unique example, of internationally recognized, non profit artist-run spaces. Situated in the historic quarter San Niccolò, Zona’s involvement with the experimental art movements of the 1970s and 1980s: multimedia art, concrete poetry, Conceptual art, performance, contrasted with the everyday life of the neighborhood.In accordance with its mission - o show interdisciplinary work on an international level - Zona’s program sought a crossover of experimental visual arts, music, architecture, and poetry. The aim of overcoming traditional borders between the disciplines was achieved through a radical, anti-academic organization, and through the confrontation of the audience with unusual insights into multifaceted art experiments and experiences that anticipated developments in the visual arts. Zona’s activities included more than 250 exhibitions/events as well as Zona publications and editions. In 1981 ZonaRadio went online, broadcasting new music and sound by artists. “Zona People” formed a flexible collective, without long term programming. Flexibility was important as there was no financial support either from private sponsors or from public institutions. Zona’s program was completely self-financed by the members of the space. Zona built up an international network that promoted new art movements and opened up the possibility of a global exchange between artists, art critics, and the public._x000D_ Organization: The nonprofit art space Zona was founded and organized by artists, musicians, poets, and architects, who were living and working in Florence.Mission: Creation of a global network of interdisciplinary art practices and exhibition of international experimental art in Florence.Program: Avant-garde art movements of the 1970s and 1980s, film and video, Conceptual art, Fluxus, performance, concrete and sound poetry, radical architecture, artists’ books and small press, audioworks, ZonaRadio.Today: Zona Archives and Zona Archives Editions Zona non profit art space and zona archives in Florenceby Maurizio Nannucci_x000D_ Zona was created in 1974 out of the need and desire of a group of young artists to infiltrate Florence with contemporary art; the city is an environment historically inclined to maintain the status-quo and tradition, and is not open to change. Only with a profound knowledge of the city's social, political, cultural, and economic mechanisms, can the extraordinary significance of the artist-run space Zona and what the collective represented be appreciated. In the 1970s there was huge international resistance to the establishment art galleries and to the ever greater power being acquired by militant criticism. As a result, many artists claimed their own autonomy, and undertook to create a strategic alternative circuit that would provide a direct link between their own work and the media, modifying the social status of culture and of its environment. Having abandoned 1968-inspired utopias, there was a move toward transparent, independent operations run by the artists themselves. By adopting Walter Benjamin's ideas about the reproducibility of art and Marshall McLuhan's concept of electronic multimedia forms, the artists aimed to eliminate the traditional qualitative parameters of art and to adopt new forms of anti-conformist behavior that would transform the artist’s role in society. Zona was founded as a nonprofitorganization and space run by artists, architects, and musicians who were living and working in Florence and Tuscany: Maurizio Nannucci, Paolo Masi, Mario Mariotti, Giuseppe Chiari, Massimo Nannucci, Alberto Moretti, Alberto Mayr and Gianni Pettena. The exhibition space was on the Via San Niccolò 119r, inside the historical city center. The founding of Zona took place during a period of great upheaval; a small group of people with great vision and a high level of professionalism undertook to bring the cultural scene in Florence into the contemporary world, and visa versa. As well as Zona, there were galleries such as Schema and Area, the Centro Di publishing company, and video works created by Art Tapes 22 and Edizioni Exempla. All these initiatives helped bring about a period of extreme cultural ferment in the city, driven by the energy of a new generation of artists._x000D_ Zona ProgramFrom the very beginning the Zona collective decided that information and the exhibition program should be the deciding factors in the identity and activities of the space, rather than individual self-conceit and self-reflecting narcissism. The strategy of opening up the exchange to the international art world meant that different cultures and experimental operative methods became part of Zona’s collective actions. Zona carefully cultivated a network of contacts and shared experiences with artists from different disciplines and tendencies from emerging contemporary fields. For this purpose, Zona People were engaged at Zona, and worked without receiving any financial remuneration. As a further programmatic decision, the members of Zona reinforced their definition of themselves as an integrated body or collective. The confrontation of different disciplines and personalities became a driving force that contributed to the identity of Zona as an organization that was non-hierarchical and led by democratic ideas such as that art production should be inhomogeneous, contradictory, varied and articulate, diffuse and noisy, and non-identifiable in traditional terms, values, and expectations. _x000D_ Autonomy and IndependenceZona’s connection with the local public and governmental institutions was characterized by an operative independence and autonomy; thus it was only rarely possible to present exhibitions such as Made in Florence, and others devoted to artists' books and performance. Zona differentiated itself from cultural institutions, and was responsive to sudden changes in the art world. It quickly became an internationally recognized—and preferred—channel for artistic activity, especially when compared with the lethargy and indifference of local institutions. Zona became a pure cultural concept, with a multilingual and multi-ethnic composition, a space that was neither shared nor transitory, a shelter in thesteppe, an haven in the desert, in which the artist, like a nomad or explorer, momentarily finds hospitality and feels welcome. The choice of being precarious and semi-clandestine was a very conscious one; it was felt that it was necessary to ignore the certainties of tried and tested methods and communication. This choice entailed certain difficulties, both in terms of how the organization was run as well as financial concerns—it was necessary to find approximately $1,000 a year to support general expenses. In spite of its precarious financial situation, and thanks to its agile and flexible structure and dense network of contacts, Zona was able to realize more than 250 events, exhibitions, concerts, performances, installations, lectures, and video and film presentations.Zona’s program received international acclaims, and established Zona’s reputation on the international contemporary art circuit in the 1970s and 1980s. _x000D_ Beginnings and Shared ExperiencesThe event that officially inaugurated the space in 1975 was Per Conoscenza, an enquiry into artists of different disciplines active in Florence and Tuscany; a sort of getting to know ""who we are and what we do,"" without becoming lost in local impulses that could subsequently be called regionalism or nationalism. The exhibition was made up of a series of 35 one-day shows, performances, films, and installations (with contributions by Luciano Bartolini, Lapo Binazzi & Ufo, Mario Borillo, Lino Centi, Giuseppe Chiari, Andrea Daninos, Bruno Gambone, Andrea Granchi, Ketty La Rocca, Auro Lecci, Mario Mariotti, Paolo Masi, Gianni Melotti, Verita Monselles, Alberto Moretti, Massimo Nannucci, Maurizio Nannucci, Adolfo Natalini & Superstudio, Bill Viola, among others). As Zona’s inaugural event, Per Conoscenza created a basic formula that would be used again in 1978 and 1981 for other events such as Aroma (which included Carlo Bertocci, Fabrizio Corneli, Luciana Majoni, Monica Sarsini, Marino Vismara).Another paradigmatic event was Monografie curated by Mario Mariotti, an exhibition in 1977 of practitioners who assumed different artistic roles (Lapo Binazzi, Julien Blaine, Corrado Costa, Mario Guaraldi, Paolo Masi, Massimo Nannucci, Maurizio Nannucci, Fulvio Salvadori, etc. ). A series of 28 events allowed over 50 participants to express themselves, either individually or in a group. Artistic practices ranged from artist to editor, from architect to musician, from collector to craftsman._x000D_ Collective Publishing and Extended Communication After these first events featuring local artists, a whole series of manifestations followed, through which Zona was able to better demonstrate its role as a catalyst of a wide range of experiences and international events. A perfect example of this was the Small Press Scene exhibition in 1975. Curated by Maurizio Nannucci, it was the first to be devoted to this medium, gathering together more than 250 small press magazines dedicated to experimental visual art, concrete poetry, architecture, and new music (Agentzia, Ana Excetera, Ant Farm, Approches, Archigram, Art and Language, Art Rite, Asa, Axe, Azimuth, Coracle Press / Simon Cutts, Exempla, Fluxus, The Fox, Futura, Geiger, Giorno Poetry System, Integration / Hermann De Vries, La Mamelle, Nul, Le Petit Colosse de Simi / Daniel Spoerri, Poor Old Tired Horse / Ian Hamilton Finlay, Robho, Dieter Rot, Schema Informazione, Stereo Headphone, Tarasque Press, Tau/Ma, Vou, Zaj, etc.). This was the first presentation of artistic production tied to the Intermedia phenomenon, which had started in the 1960s at a time when some artists felt the need to release their work from the production of art objects, and wished to address interests and concerns related to other disciplinary categories. Their work opened up artistic research to other possibilities and experimentation. The small press materials today constitute one of the most consistent aspects of Zona Archives, which has grown consistently and which now contains over 1,000 titles. The initiative continued with a series of artists’ magazines and artists-as-editors presentations such as Oolp (Luigi Ballerini, Mario Diacono), BaoBab and Geiger (Adriano Spatola), The Fox (Joseph Kosuth), Mèla (Maurizio Nannucci), Other Books and So (Ulysses Carrion), File (General Idea),Zweitschrift (Uta Brandes, Michael Erlhoff), Pim (Jeffrey Isaac), Aut, Trib(Tullio Catalano, Maurizio Benveduti), AEIUO (Bruno Corà), Impulse (Elton Garnet), Giorno Poetry System (John Giorno). Small Press Scene was also the name of a 24-hour nonstop event of alternative information about small press, which took place in June 1984. It is also worth mentioning the British Small Press Book Fair (which took place at Zona in May, 1978) dedicated to the activity of small press in Britain, and which presented 50 magazines, including Poor.Old.Tired.Horse by Ian Hamilton Finlay and Archigram edited by Peter Cook. Inbound/Outbound was an exhibition in 1977, the contents of which were sent directly to Zona (who had solicited their participation) by 100 artists from all over the world, with particular attention to East Europe countries, South America, Japan, and Australia._x000D_ Audioworks and Zona Radio Maurizio Nannuccci started the Fonoteca (1977) a collection of records and cassettes of artists' audioworks and sound poetry, as well as previously unpublished original recordings. An exhibition of sound installations was shown at Zona for the first time; this later became a traveling show and went to museums in France, Austria, Mexico, and elsewhere. In the same year, Albert Mayr’s Suono & Ambiente festival increased awareness of sound art, and provided information about related events in different parts of the world. The festival took place at several venues in Florence, with concerts and musical actions by Beth Andersen, Cornelius Cardew, Giancarlo Cardini, Richard Hyman, and Alvin Lucier among others.Parola e Suono (1979) was a review dedicated to meetings with authors of musical poetry and phonetic researchers. This has to be considered, like other manifestations, as a ""work in progress,"" still open to further contributions. Ulysses Carrion, Henry Chopin, John Giorno, Sten Hanson, Bernard Heidsieck, Isidor Isou, Ferdinand Kriwet, Robert Lax, Maurice Lemaitre, Maurizio Nannucci, Diter Rot, Mimmo Rotella, Gerhard Rühm, Sarkis, and Adriano Spatola were presented, and Zona organized the attendance of other authors such as Brion Gysin, Ernst Jandl, Friederike Mayröcker, and Emmett Williams.A further contribution to the greater understanding and awareness of this form of sound research came with the creation of ZonaRadio. ZonaRadio continued the kind of research into sound seen at the Zona events with a cycle of radiophonic transmissions at the invitation of Florence's broadcasting station Controradio 93,7mHz (as well as from some foreign stations in the Netherlands, Canada, Germany, and Sweden. Over a period of three months Maurizio Nannucci and Albert Mayr broadcast interviews with as well as recordings and sound material by hundreds of artists such as Vito Acconci, Laurie Anderson, Robert Barry, Joseph Beuys, John Cage, Philip Corner, Coum Transmission, Antonio Dias, Brian Eno, Philip Glass, Jack Goldstein, Dick Higgins, Robert Lax, Albert Mayr, Maurizio Nannucci, Michael Snow, Keith Sonnier, Ben Vautier, and Lawrence Weiner. Their approach was an attempt to distance themselves from traditional broadcasting, and rather to adopt an editorial method that, without distorting the meaning of the transmitted works, would emphasize a cognitive approach suited to the medium of radio. In 1982 a special emmission of ZonaRadio was created in connection with the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz. In 1985, once again at the invitiation of Controradio, ZonaRadio Events broadcast new audio material. Yves Bouliane, Logos Gent, Giuseppe Chiari, Steve Piccolo, Bill Viola, and Marino Vismara created solo installations, performances, and concerts produced by Zona Music and realized at the Palazzo Vegni in Florence between 1976 and 1981. In 1984 Albert Mayr invited some protagonists of experimental music to animate the Zona Musica Festival, which took place during five days in different indoor and outdoor venues in the city._x000D_ Zona’s International Art Network Connections with both the peripheral and more mainstream art worlds led to exhibitions such as Iceland (1979, including Fridrik Thor Fridriksson, Margrét Jonsdottir, Steingrimur Eyfjörd Kristmundsson, Magnus Palsson, Bjarni H. Thorarinsson): a presentation of Icelandic art that included artworks, films, books, and documents by 25 artists working at the forefront of contemporary dialogue. June 1984 saw the exhibition Zona Brasil, a manifestation in which Cildo Meireles, Iole de Freitas, and Carmela Gross presented their work in Zona's space. A personal connection with Canadian artists led to a series of artist's interventions (General Idea, Glenn Lewis, Ian Murray, Michael Snow, Vincent Tresov, and Bill Vazan). Zona was also linked closely to magazines and documents (including Parachute, Impulse, Impressions, Fuse,Parallelogramme, File), and was involved in information exchanges with nonprofitspaces such as A Space and Art Metropole in Toronto, and Western Front in Vancouver. In March 1980 Franklin Furnace's director Martha Wilson gave a lecture at Zona, in which she discussed alternative spaces and archives in New York, focusing particularly on Franklin Furnace, whose archive was purchased by The Museum of Modern Art in New York in the 1990s.Zona Genève, curated in 1983 by Marino Vismara and including work by Françoise Bridel, Vivianne van Singer, Jean Stern, and Anne Sauser Hall, was an exhibition of a group of young artists working in Geneva and involved with the Furor art theory magazine. The show was organized as a result of exchanges with Swiss artist-run spaces in Geneva such as Ecart, Gaetan, and the Centre d'Art Contemporain. A.u.s.t.r.a.l.i.a (May/July 1983), curated by Maurizio Nannucci and Judith Blackall took place around the same time. It was the first European exploration of the Australian art scene, showing a variety of media and with the participation of over 30 artists (including Julie Brown, Juan Davila, John Nixon, Jill Orr, Imants Tiller, and Jenny Watson). Zona also presented videos featuring productions from Berlin and Great Britain; the exhibition America in a Box (1983) showed Sheila Klein and Gail MacCall, and was accomplished through a collaboration of Studio Alchymia, an Italian design studio. The Guerrilla Girls presented an exhibition of their leaflets and documents of political actions regarding discrimination against women in the art world (1985)._x000D_ Distribution and Circulation of Information Zona also collected information about other exhibitons, tracing visual art's most significant developments. As a result of Zona’s policy of showing an artist only for an evening, or limiting the event to the time required to make it possible, the space was extremely dynamic, in sharp contrast to the more established spaces in Florence, which were not reactive or responsive to new artistic developments.Zona realized several solo exhibitions and events with artists such as Alighiero Boetti, James Lee Byars, Sarah Charlesworth, James Coleman, Peter Downsbrough, Terry Fox, General Idea, Jeffrey Isaac, Joseph Kosuth, Mario Merz, Steve Piccolo, and Bill Viola. Following the same style of exhibiton, but integrated in a thematic context, group exhibitions were held with artists such as Giuseppe Chiari, Fabrizio Corneli, Mario Mariotti, Paolo Masi, Alberto Moretti, Massimo Nannucci, Maurizio Nannucci, and Marino Vismara. Steve Piccolo, the bass player of the musical group Lounge Lizard, made particularly notable interventions in Demos Project (with Maurizio Nannucci) and in the Le Pietre Graffiate exhibition; he also performanced with Piero Pelù, the lead singer of the Florentine rock group Litfiba, at the Vivita gallery for the opening party of Nannucci’s solo exhibition in the Sala d’Arme at the Palazzo Vecchio. In February 1978 Magazzini Criminali (Marion d'Amburgo, Sandro Lombardi, and Federico Tiezzi), invaded Zona's space with a series of theatrical events entitled II Carrozzone. A performance-homage to Ketty La Rocca, in which Gianni Melotti, Verita Monselles, and Fulvio Salvadori also took part, was presented in Zona’s cellars.Exhibitions with Mario Merz and Alighiero Boetti corresponded to an open project for which Zona's space was “lent” to a series of galleries. The galleries/gallerists involved in Zona events were Franco Toselli’s Milan Gallery (Merz), Massimo Minini from Brescia (Boetti), followed by the Lucio Amelio’s Napolitan Gallery, which presented Ernesto D'Argenio at Zona Space, as well as Francoise Lambert from Milan who showed Alberto Garutti.Mater Materia (1977) was an exploration by Lanfranco Baldi, Carlo Bertocci, and Paolo Masi into the poetry of materials through images, books, critical articles, samplings, and editions donated by over 80 European and American artists.The series Zona Critica (March–June 1982)presented theoretical information and artworks, documenting a series of contemporary situations new to the critical field. This event characterized the beginning of the 1980s in Italy. Each of the critics invited (Rossella Bonfiglioli, Laura Cherubini, Massimo Carboni, Maria Luisa Frisa, Elio Grazioli, Flaminio Gualdoni, Ida Panicelli, Demetrio Paparoni, Loredana Parmesani, Sandro Sproccati, Barbara Tosi, Giorgio Verzotti) asked an artist to intervene in Zona's space, which became a direct intermediary between the critics and the cultural space: a precursor to other, similar manifestations._x000D_ Crossing DisciplinesZona Architettura Corretta Londinese (1979), curated by Gianni Pettena with the British Council and the Architectural Association in London's cooperation, proposed, on a weekly basis, an overview of the emerging school of London's young architects who approached their practice through research into the environment and physical space. John Andrews, Nigel Coats, Christopher Harding, Antonio Lagarto, Jenny Löwe, John Ryba, Trisha Pringle, and Peter Wilson followed one another with installations produced and carried out in situ, as interpretations of Zona’s space. Their installations used post-conceptual spatial language and were far from being purely graphic representations of real constructions; these interventions acted as references for those by previous architects such as Lapo Binazzi/UFO, Michele De Lucchi/Cavart, Ugo La Pietra, Adolfo Natalini/Superstudio, Gianni Pettena, who were part of the Architettura Radicale group. In May 1984 Gianni Pettena also organized the Theatrium Artium review, with 12 international architects' plans for the same numbers of pavilions around the amphitheatre in the Cascine Park in Florence.On the occasion of the inauguration of the Istituto Patafisico per l'Etruria and the Proto-Istituto Alternativo Zona,the documents and editions of the College de ’Pataphisique, were shown in Italy for the first time. ZonaPatafisica, 1981, curated by Maurizio Nannucci and Thierry Foulc, presented material from the College de ’Pataphisique archive, with over three hundred publications of books, magazine, cards, booklets by Antonin Artaud, Jean Dubuffet, Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, Lucio Fontana, Alfred Jarry, Raymond Queneau, and Man Ray. In 1977, more than ten years before the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, Maurizio Nannucci curated an exhibition that gathered together material relating to Situationism, some 20 years after its creation. Zona Internationale Situationniste presented magazines, books, films, and original articles written by the protagonists, as well as related materials from all over Europe—a kind of free consulting library. The opening was memorable for the unexpected presence of Guy Debord.For the exhibition Zona Invitation Postcards in December 1977, Maurizio Nannucci asked Pier Luigi Tazzi and Luciano Bartolini to carry out a first critical enquiry into the unusual subject of invitation cards—not only the exhibition invitation cards sent by galleries and museums, but also those sent by the artists themselves. A series of categories proposed, through the presentation of over three thousands examples collected by Exempla Archive, the creative and original elements that artists use to send messages and to document their own work._x000D_ Zona Films, Videos, and Multimedia More than once Zona'sspace was turned into a cinema with projections of artist's films. Zona Artist's Films (1976) was an international festival organized by Maurizio Nannucci and Andrea Granchi, which lasted over three months with 40 days of projections. There were also monographic evenings in which many artists took part (Joseph Beuys, Mari Boyen, Marcel Broothaers, Antonio Dias, Herbert Distel, Terry Fox, Dan Graham, Gordon Matta-Clark, Alberto Moretti, Massimo Nannucci, Bruce Nauman, Dennis Oppenheim, Luca Patella, Angela Ricci Lucchi & Yervant Gianikian, Franco Vaccari, etc.).Independent Super8 Films from Australia, 1983, was a festival presented in parallel to the exhibition A.U.S.T.R.A L.I.A,dedicated to new art scene of this continent. In 1975 Bill Viola’s first video installation, Vapore, was presented; at this time he was also contributing to the activity of Art Tapes 22 created by Maria Gloria Bicocchi. Collaborating with Bicocchi Zona organized meetings with Vito Acconci, Daniel Buren, Buckminster Fuller, Tadeusz Kantor, and Living Theatre. Video Arte in Gran Bretagne took place in 1984 and the complete video and film works of Gilbert & George, realized with the assistence of the British Council, were presented. Zona and some of the collective’s artist-members were frequently invited to produce projects in public institutions and museums, often reworking and extending initiatives created in Via San Niccolò, or simply proposing the same projects again. Collaborations took place with the Archives of the Venice Biennale and the Moderna Museetin Stockholm for the Small Press Sceneexhibition, and with the City of Florence for the exhibitions Formato Lib(&)ro, 1978, and Artists’ Books, 1978. The DAV archive (Documentazione Arti Visive, 1980–1982) was also created by Maurizio Nannucci for the City of Florence. Other collaborations were realized with the Paris Biennale;the Padiglione d’Arte Contemporanea in Milan; the Centre Georges Pompidou and Bibliothèque Nationalein Paris for Cent Livres d'Artistes Italiens (1981); as well as with MoMA, New York; the Frankfurter Kunstverein; the British Council, London; and Rai, Rome._x000D_ Zona ArchivesEstablishing the Zona Archives at this time, and the start of its editorial activity was very important; material is still being added to the archives today. The material that has been collected includes: the small press collection, artists’ books (four thousand books), audioworks by artists with records and tapes of new music (over one thousand items), audioworks by artists and poets, and the concrete poetry collection (more than six thousand documents) with which the Exempla Archive's materials have been merged. Zona has not simply collected and released information, but also have their own autonomous editorial activity, Zona Editions, which has not limited itself to the publication of catalogues and books about Zona events, but has also produced (and continues to do so), records, artists’ books, editions, and multiples by artists such as Paul Armand Gette, John Armleder, Luciano Bartolini, Claude Closky, Robert Filliou, Rainer Ganahl, General Idea, John Giorno, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Dick Higgins, Joseph Kosuth, Robert Lax, James Lee Byars, Sol Lewitt, Paolo Masi, Jonathan Monk, Olivier Mosset, Massimo Nannucci, Maurizio Nannucci, Carsten Nicolai, John Nixon & Marco Fusinato, Yoko Ono, Michael Snow, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Lawrence Weiner, Heimo Zobernig. Although the artist-run space in Via San Nicolò 119r was closed in 1985, Zona's activity has continued through the archives and the organization of external events. Zona Secret Events (Daniel Buren, Terry Fox, General Idea, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, James Lee Byars, Maurizio Nannucci, Lawrence Weiner, etc.) invites artists to intervene in different places in Florence with hidden (often clandestine) works. The presence of these works is voluntarily concealed and any search for them is helped only by insufficient clues. Zona Archives regularly supplies materials, documents, and works to art institutions that request them for their exhibitions. Zona has also produced exhibitions and events. Among these are A.P./Artists Photographs (John Baldessari, Christian Boltanski, Luciano Fabro, Fischli and Weiss, Dan Graham, Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, Ed Ruscha, Cindy Sherman, etc. ), which took place at the Archivio Storico in Marciana, Isola d’Elba (1986), and A.B./Art in Bookform, organized by Maurizio Nannucci and Pier Luigi Tazzi at the Alvar Aalto Museum and the Pori Art Museum in Finland in 1987. Other projects curated by Maurizio Nannucci includeD.i.s.c.o.t.h.e.q.u.e (Maison du livre, de l’image et du son, Villeurbanne/Lyon, 1989), Bookmakers (Limoges, 1995), Murs de Son (Villa Arson, Nice, 1995), and Keeping Time, the sound archive of artists' audioworks (Zona, 1977) was shown at Villa Arson in Nice (1995), the École des Beaux Arts in Bourges (1996), the Kunstmuseum in Bregenz (1997), and the Palazzo delle Papesse in Siena (1998). Nannucci also curated the exhibitionZona People at Mamco, Centre d’art contemporain, Geneva, 2003. Zona’s objectives have never been to celebrate a particular moment of an artist's work, much less its own activity. Rather attention has always been concentrated on communication, information, and recording events that other organizations, with different remits and constraints, would not be able to record. The continuity of the commitment that has always been given to Zona has allowed it to explore areas in which it is possible to research and formulate new models of artistic methodologies and behaviors. It is precisely in terms of the continuity and the attention given to the immediate reception of events, many of which have been forgotten by more official artistic channels, that Zona has built its identity._x000D_ Small Space, Great Ideas Zonaand its collective places itself in the sphere of an international communication network strongly characterized by ideological problematics that, alone, take on all the artistic (as well as non-artistic) questions of the 1970s and 1980s. The communication is reciprocal and is a base for further elaborations. In this way all the assumptions of non-participation,of delay, of communication's autism, of provincialism are demolished.The capacity and potential to receive everything places Zona in a unique position. Zona, venue of numerous strategic points, took Florence back to a communicative centralization through minimum and marginal signs. In 1985 the members of the Zona collective decided to bring an end to their activities as a group. As a result, the decision was made to close down the space in via San Niccolò 119r, so opening a new chapter in a story that is and will continue to be exemplary.It is to these people and to these events that these pages are dedicated. Memories, but without nostalgia. Bearing witness to a conscious decision, to a gentle but intense experience, and to a path that could possibly still be taken up today. For this reason, this experience cannot be dedicated only to one single place but to the world, and especially to all those artists and people who shared it and those who want to live it today._x000D_"

TRIPODE,"The Tripode Association has organized contemporary art exhibitions since 2001. Through support, promotion, research and production aid, Tripode disseminates the work of artists under the title of various programs. In the eyes of the banking institution, the association is a moral person. However, Tripode is not a purely spiritual entity in suspension in the art. Tripode uses for its operation a variety of materials: invitation cards, wines, wood mixes, stamps, stamps, inkboard for printing, civil responsibility insurance and other coins. The public money is neither improbable nor a duo, the exhibitions of the Tripode Association are also used for its work of fashionable fashionable fashions and are also used for the use of fashionable products. Tripode invites artists whose practice is mostly derived from the field of visual arts and produces monographic exhibitions in general, at times, twice as rarely as collective as possible in the area of contemporary art. In the first locations of the association in 2002, two exhibitions, taste Exhauster and Interdit to the public where 25 exhibitions have occurred. Since 2005, the presentation proposal has proposed new episodes.

Arprim,"Arprint, an art testing centre, has the task of disseminating current practices related to printed arts.It deals with printing as an open, mobile, social and accessible medium. It is defined as an area of trial and experience conducive to the development of a pluralist vision of printed art. As a distributor of the current art, Arprim suggests to act as a privileged intermediary between artists and the public and to facilitate contact with emerging practices related to printed art. In terms of sharing ideas and active participation of each, Arprim is committed to developing alternatives to conventional art dissemination strategies. Arprim is a revolving organization that has been recognizable in time, through several wave of transformation of its foundation today. Its course begins in 1978, while dignitaries united by its discipline are on the foot of the Quebec Bureau, which will become the Quebec Press Council (CQE) in 1983. The latter plays a major role in the discipline of the artistic community throughout the 1980s, and is devoted mainly to the representation and dissemination of its members by means of publications, exhibitions and talks organized in Quebec, Canada and abroad. The CQE is also assigned to its members for the purpose of redefinition of its work."
MARS,"MARS is like a ""delegated accident"", a physical space and especially a project - which decides not to be too structured according to a classic calendar in order to progressively respond to the artistic needs of the different participants. MARS is like a ""potential box"" which, as a white cube as an aesthetically defective container, faces both diversity and inventivity.Each year on the site, a project call is open to a part of the Mars programme. Other projects are only on invitation and are managed directly by the executive. So we do not accept requests after the opening of the open call. Mars opens in Milan on 3 December 2008. It is a space managed by artists and destined for a curious audience to know more about contemporary art. The Pasteur space is born from an original idea of Lorenza Boisi and was initiated with the complexity of other artists a program for Mars, performance events, exhibitions and art, on the self-managed model.In the years following the MARS project, they participated: Alessandro Roma, Andrea Dojmi, Antonio Barletta, Dacia Manto, David Casini, Ivan Malerba, Jacopo Milliani, Laura Pugno, Lidia SANVITO, Lorenza Boisi, Luca Trevisani, Luigi Presicce, Manuel Cerutti, Nicola Gobccato, Nicolas Tobzato, Simona."

The Lab,"The Lab believes that if we give artists enough time, space, and funding to realize their vision, the work they produce will change the way we experience the world. These are often small propositions that (like all great art) challenge the familiar ways we perceive value, and so we seek out extraordinary artists who are underrepresented as a result of gender, class, race, sexuality, or geography, and whose work is not easily defined and therefore monetized. As a site of constant iteration and indeterminacy, The Lab is, above all, a catalyst for artistic experimentation._x000D_ The Lab is W.A.G.E. Certified. W.A.G.E.

SHED,"In the area of exhibition of 600 m2 there are areas of residence and work: a workshop (200 m2), a accommodation for the hosted artists, as well as four workshops and private storage spaces.The scope of the site, the commitment of artists and curators and the independence of the art centre enables us to consider ambitious projects and the invitation of internationally named artists in France to emerging artists.We want to develop this axis in all our proposals (2 to 3 exhibitions per year), offering artists space and time for research and experimentation adapted to their work rhythms for several years. Opened in September 2015, SHED is an independent contemporary art centre. Located near Rouen (1h30 from Paris and a few minutes from Mont-Saint-Aignan). Located in an old shopping mall, typical of the industrial buildings of the 19th century, SheD offers 600 m2 of exposure space. The extent of the site is in the architecture of even the factories built during this period: a free plan, a power-powered structure, a ceiling height (4 meters under the bridge, 6.5 meters below the factory). This volume is exceptional in our region, no exhibition site in Normandy offering such space. It allows us to consider the presentation of large pieces of space. Created and managed by a group of artists and curators, the SHED is a private initiative. The building (1 400 m2) is the co-ownership of Pierre Ardouvin and Anne Brégeaut, Jean-Paul Berrenger, Julie Faitot, Jonathan Loppin, Aurele Orion and Bruno Peinado. Co-owners of the building have chosen to make half of the area available for the development of the art centre.

El Mentidero,"El Mentidero is a home in downtown Bogotá. It is content and container-bucket and water at the same time. An exhibition space for non-productive merchandise, selling religious artifacts for non-believers, a set for unrelated relationships. Market without marketing. Use and disuse. One for all, all for one.Strategically located in its place, El Mentidero closes its doors to some and others and is inhabited by insatiable and problematic artists, masses eager of hay and poison, chefs with PhDs, broke students and broken teachers. Behind these doors a new school is being formed, without grades and without degrees but with toga and lots of class."

Gallery 44,"Gallery 44 is centered on three programming areas:_x000D_ We offer affordable production facilities to over 400 artist members, including darkrooms and digital printing, ensuring that artists working across diverse media have an accessible space to experiment and develop their photo-based practices.Providing a similarly accessible gallery space, G44 presents dynamic exhibitions that reflect a range of contemporary issues and visual forms. As a mentor-focused institution, rather than a curator-focused one, we maintain a collaborative approach in which artists play a central and active role in shaping programming and supporting one another’s artistic development. G44 dedicates significant portions of our programming calendar each year to focusing on emerging artists. Longstanding programs, such as Proof and Cameralinks, provide a place for artists at the cusp of their own explorations into seeing to widen the dialogue around contemporary photography.An equally important part of our mandate is to provide production, exhibition, mentorship and scholarship opportunities to youth throughout the GTA. Gallery 44’s OUTREACH program, for example, offers photography workshops to youth from underserved communities. This unique program inspires youth to develop positive methods of sharing their stories and to initiate critical explorations into art-viewing and art-making. As one of the only artist-run centres in Canada providing ongoing, hands-on arts education to youth, our award-winning education programs encourage greater visual literacy, while fostering a new generation of artists. Gallery 44 Centre for Contemporary Photography is a charitable, non-profit, artist-run centre committed to supporting multi-faceted approaches to photography and lens-based media. Founded in 1979 to establish a supportive environment for the development of artistic practice, Gallery 44’s mandate is to provide a context for meaningful reflection and dialogue on contemporary photography._x000D_ Gallery 44 is committed to programs that reflect the continuously changing definition of photography by presenting a wide range of practices that engage timely and critical explorations of the medium. Through exhibitions, public engagement, education programs and production facilities our objective is to explore the artistic, cultural, historic, social and political implications of the image in our ever-expanding visual world. Gallery 44 was founded in 1979 by a small group of artists in need of production facilities who joined together to share darkroom and studio space. Forming a collective was an important first step in making facilities affordable and in creating a supportive community of artists with common goals. In 1980, the collective began mounting exhibitions and in 1981 began offering photography workshops._x000D_ Gallery 44 moved from its original location on Niagara Street to Bathurst Street in 1986, where both the production and exhibition facilities were expanded to serve a growing membership. Due to a severe lack of photographic education in elementary and secondary schools, Gallery 44 began its Education in the Schools program in 1987. In 1994, Gallery 44 moved to 401 Richmond St. W. to improve the centre's exhibition and production facilities and to widen its audience through a more centralized location._x000D_ The main floor of our space currently includes the administrative office, main gallery and adjacent vitrines gallery that host our seven annual exhibitions and our Members’ Gallery, which exclusively showcases the work of our members. Gallery 44’s 2,673 square foot, accessible facilities are located in the basement of 401 and include darkrooms, a shooting studio, scanning lab, wide format digital printing, print finishing area, resource library, and the Production Gallery which highlights works produced in our facilities. _x000D_ Throughout its history Gallery 44 has prioritized equitable access by breaking down barriers to the arts for artists, audiences and youth. We do so by programming outside of the downtown core, collaborating with numerous community partners both within and outside of our sector, supporting artistic experimentation and risk-taking and providing accessible public programs and production support to emerging practitioners, diverse artists and young people from across the GTA. Gallery 44’s partners include: ImagineNATIVE, Images Festival, Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival, Toronto District School Board, OCAD University, Trinity Square Video, NIA Centre for the Arts, Tangled Art + Disability and many more. _x000D_ While Gallery 44 continues to develop and evolve we have remained committed to our history as an artist-run centre, which in part relates to fostering collaborative decision-making and the sharing of leadership roles.

With its characteristic high ceiling, flexible lighting conditions and ideal exhibition layout, Black Sesame is a unique 'white cube' located in one of Beijing's best preserved courtyards._x000D_ Apart from being closely linked to IFP's residency programme and the resident artists, Black Sesame also works as a meeting space between the local Beijing art scene and international community of artists. With a programme focussing on solo exhibitions mixing Chinese and international artists with overlapping themes or interests, we encourage hands-on experimentation and transformation of the space itself. Artists and exhibitions are linked together through a programme which includes artists talks and performances. Institute for Provocation (IFP) is a Beijing based independent art organization and project space founded in 2010. Combining the study of theory and artistic practice, IFP aims to combine cross-disciplinary knowledge and stimulate cultural exchange and production in a collective approach. IFP organizes and advocates various kinds of activities, including artist residency, research project, discussion, exhibition making, workshop, publication, etc. on the basis of considering the dynamics of the relationship of independent art space with the society. Through a wide network of artists, researchers and makers in China and beyond, IFP can provide intelligence to incoming residents and collaborators who themselves become part of the network. We reckon the interaction between practice of residence artists and IFP’s institutional practice are constantly in a relationship of mutual provocation, friction and cooperation."
W,"W was installed in the East of Paris, in Pantin in February 2010. The space has two very different potentials: the first level is an abbreviation space, the second working space. W aims at the quality of the expressions and meetings. We have created a tool to take risks, an independent experiment space. Nine W artists, each of them build a single practice, and each of these practices is absolutely based on its headquarters. The project is alive because they work together of different methods and models.

221A,"In 2015, 221A opened Semi-Public, a 3,000 square foot outdoor exhibition site, complicating its role in Vancouver’s contemporary art ecology. However, as the organization grew, it found its ambitions increasingly restricted by the disciplinary conventions, compressed timelines, and precarious economics of the artist-run centre (ARC). In his history of magisterial artist-run culture in Canada (1962-2012), Vincent Bonin describes how the ARC’s original project of emancipation, of both artist and society, was abandoned after decades of creative stagnation and bureaucratic red tape. The organization likewise found that the methods and logics of the traditional ARC could only interpret the world in various ways; 221A wants to change it. Consequently, 221A’s vision is to support artists to transform the cultural, ecological, and economic contexts they emerge from._x000D_ Beginning in Fall 2017, 221A’s programming was comprehensively restructured around a ‘fellowship & infrastructure’ model. Unlike a standard exhibition or commission, the fellowship program will host artists over an extended period of time, engaging with contexts, collaborators, ideas, and audiences. Over the course of three to twenty-four months, the fellow will occupy 221A’s former exhibition space and working with the staff to lead the organization’s artistic pursuits._x000D_ The fellowship program will develop research that leads to new social, cultural, or ecological ‘infrastructure’. 221A defines infrastructure as flexible, semi-permanent projects and systems that exceed traditional forms of (art) production in their capacity to respond to fluctuating realities and needs. Whereas 221A’s peers and mentors—traditional ARC’s and public galleries—are institutions that commission and exhibit artist works, the ‘fellowship & infrastructure’ model empowers artists to use the institution itself as a medium. Fellows will mobilize an expanded set of instruments—finances, communications, facilities, and human resources—to realize projects that intervene in, and hopefully transform, our contexts in contemporary society. 221A is a non-profit artist-run centre that presents exhibitions, talks, publications and special projects that explore the role of design in the shaping of contemporary societies. Beginning as a student-led initiative in 2005, the organization was initially animated by an opposition to the division between contemporary art and design. Leaving the university grounds in 2008 to establish its first public exhibition space, the organization would be shaped by the history and upheavals of its new home in Chinatown, the embattled neighbourhood itself a microcosm of a global economic recession and the transformation of Vancouver before and after the 2010 Winter Olympics."

Founded in 1984, the 3rd Imperial, the current art testing centre was the first centre of artists from the Quebec and Canadian network to devote themselves to the exploration of the current art in areas not normally dedicated to it. Since 1995, in an intervention methodology focused on contexts, outside the conventional space of the gallery, the Centre has developed an art approach that takes place in daily life. Since then it has continued to refine its work processes and adapt to the changing needs of the current art in the contemporary world and its report."

articule,"Site-specific choreography and performance (Dena Davida, 1979, Mona Hatoum, 1983) through Fluxus theatre (Geoffrey Hendricks et John Giorno, 1996-97), to travelling interventions (Bookmobile, 2001) and the VIVA! art action (2006 - ), articule supports practices associated with performance art in its broadest terms, and has made a significant contribution to the development of this discipline in the Montréal region.articule’s programming is equally marked by a desire to take art outside of the gallery walls. An agreement established with Montréal retailers has given artists the opportunity to exhibit in store fronts since the early 1980s. This practice continues today with subsequent exhibitions and events being held in apartment buildings, hospitals, retirement homes, theatres, cinemas, parks, and a Salvation Army centre, to name but a few venues._x000D_ In tandem with its exhibition programme, articule has developed different avenues of activity in response to the needs and trends of the milieu. Examples of note would be the multimedia programming of the 1990s, comprising, for example, the work of Trinh T. Minh-ha, Steve Reinke and Pipilotti Rist; Special Projects, allowing for more site-specific works (1994 onwards); the conservation projects (2000 onwards), such as Hôpital (2001) and Carolee Schneeman’s 2005 exhibition, and the in-house window projects initiated in 2007._x000D_ An enduring discursive tradition began in articule’s first decade, with the publication of Discussion (1981-1989). With important thematic conferences, publications, and workshops bringing national and international artists together, this space has continued to thrive as a centre for dialogue and knowledge sharing._x000D_ Since 1979, articule has supported a great number of young artists, offering many a first opportunity to exhibit their work in a professional environment. At the same time, the centre has given the public the opportunity to discover artists of international renown. Among such artists are Marie Chouinard (1979), François Morelli, Stephen Scholfield, (1980-81), Lisa Steele, Pierre Falardeau (1982-83), Bill Vazan, Michael Snow, Chris Burden (1983-84), Martha Rosler (1984-85), Ed Pien (1985-1986), Peter Doig (1989-1990), Robert Houle (1991-1992), Pipilotti Rist (1993-94), John Giorno (1996-97), Dena Davida, (1998-99), Julie-Andrée T.

We are open to all disciplines, and present exhibitions and action- and research-based works. articule curates events, such as screenings and forums, to explore specific themes or artistic practices. Our flexible short-term programming, known as Special Projects, answers to the time-sensitive needs and initiatives of artists as they arise. This programming channel pays particular attention to “undisciplined” practices and projects that manifest themselves in site-specific contexts or alternative locations. articule provides critical writings, as well as a program of discussions, conferences and workshops to encourage exchanges between artists and the public. Recognizing the importance of community and knowledge-sharing, we initiate and participate in numerous collaborative projects with other artist-run centres and community organizations. Through our engaging programming, we offer a fertile space for creativity, both to our organization and a diverse public. articule was founded in 1979 and incorporated as a non-profit organization in 1980 by a group of young artists who wanted to create a place of multidisciplinary presentation focused on research and artistic experimentation. These artists have come together to rent a space on the de la Montagne Street in Montreal, and shared programming and management. articulates became part of, what was called at the time, the network of parallel galleries. The organization has subsequently moved a few times in the central neighborhoods of Montreal. Since 2006, it's been occupying a bright space in the multicultural and lively Mile End. In 2009-2010, articulates celebrated its thirtieth anniversary with a thematic programming and Event Fundraising Who's Who which brought together artists who contributed to the center during its history._x000D_"

C5,"C5 is a space for visual arts who takes inspiration from “The Holy Theatre”, second chapter of Peter Brooks’s controversial theory “The Empty Space”. The author explains that he could have substituted the name Holy Theatre with The Theatre of the Invisible-Made-Visible. It’s all there. This space probes possibilities and tentatives which seem able to reveal something out-of-the-ordinary to the viewer. It offers an experience that overflows from the ordinary. Let’s imagine this to be somewhere that can replace the sites of sacred rituals long since forgotten, somewhere to live out transcendental experiences. Something invisible – something unsayable – must occur here. C5 intends to grant its audience experiences which tear them away from the everyday, all the while placing their feet firmly on the ground. Perceive what is sacred, yet remain anchored. That is the only way for the sacred to remain what it is in essence: never wholly uncovered. This is a slither of light creeping in through a door left ajar."
Botschaft,"Botschaft e.V. (1990-1996)The text is based on a ""talk"" from 17.10.1994 at Botschaft.The participants were Bettina Ellerkamp, Natascha Sadr Haghigian, Jörg Heitmann, Christoph Keller, Merle Kröger, Ed van Megen, Philip Scheffner, Pit Schulz, Florian Zeyfang. Strategy and Party_x000D_ The story of Botschaft can be read as follows: In the beginning there was a wish to find crossovers between different disciplines like i.e. art, science, TV. and every day life, in order to define new contexts. The motivation came from the unsatisfying situation of isolated individualism. As a result of this togetherness, the possibility prospered for the individual to use technical as well as communicative structures._x000D_ Dromomania 01 was the first event of Botschaft after renovating the squatted 4th floor of the WMF-Building, and ""united-party"" (3.10.1990; the German reunification date). Artistic reasoning was connected with political interest, the situation in the squatted house, and the reconstruction plans at the nearby Potsdamer Platz (the central place of Berlin). There was a concrete interest for local publicity. To concentrate on the interaction, none of the Botschaft members appeared in public with their own projects. Later a search started to integrate personal interests. Today, work is done by different kinds of group constellations, Botschaft functions as an information pool, work- and thought space. Out of a yearning for continuation of discourse, most of the members stuck on certain themes. Projects ran through different phases and as a consequence it came to differentiation and a more intensive interest. In the best case, these different point of views expanded, broadened the discussion, in the worst case they led to an obstruction of handling._x000D_ The attempt with Dromomania to bring together different disciplines, regarding a theme, was a model. ""Richtig 92"" 02 was the further developing of this idea. Border areas were sought, where valuation exists beyond the duality of right and wrong, true and untrue. Various projects and actions emerged from that. The different positions were presented one after the other and successively linked. Although different particles of publicity couldn't be brought together 03 , ""richtig 92"" reached a wide spectrum of people because of the heterogeneity of the projects._x000D_ What Botschaft is, has developed out of the continuity of events. The work is less strategic as it seems and it should be understood as an ongoing process. Instead of theoretical farness, rather practical nearness. It has less to do with art, maybe more with cultural work in the broadest way one can define cultural. This means being a place for interdisciplinary work in the center of Berlin as well as offering drinks and functioning as a bar. The local reference is central, the question about the art system rather peripheral. The ""Friseur"" was opened 1992 to confront events with a bar audience. Film screenings, video projections, music appearances, political lectures and art exhibitions took place. The art system is not strategically exhausted but rather used as any other system 04 . Invitations from the art context are often answered with self representations, which also reflects the actual relationship of Botschaft towards the institutions concerned and art in general._x000D_ Botschaft is not only known in a local area, but also in a peripheral group inside the European art centers, which means in the periphery of a so called peripheral area of art we reach a certain circle. To agitate local means addressing a wide spectrum of people. To be known by a group at the brink of the international art scene confirms the image of avant-garde in art._x000D_ The way Botschaft events like i.e. a party functions without strategy has its advantages and justification - one can't arrange ""everything"" by strategy-. To renounce a systematic and success oriented program creates room for action. In a certain way this is also - let's not call it; strategy - a concept. If i.e. the connection between Botschaft, ""Friseur"" (the bar) and the WMF-club (the discotheque) is being offensively represented, than just to demonstrate the rooting in different surroundings and to show that Botschaft is not just present in the art system. To concentrate on a group-strategy would have meant to name Dogfilm 05 Botschaft TV, the WMF-club Botschaft CLUB, and all members would have published under this label called Botschaft. Corporate Identity - Multi-Imperium - But it isn't necessary, cause the links are being made anyhow._x000D_ Considerations of becoming an institution were rejected because of the experience with ABM-jobs 06. Botschaft exists because of content, not by doing administration work. The two years with ABM and the bureaucratic bulk, paralyzed work and partly discussions were repressed. Today some members finance themselves by producing for a (B TV-magazine others by bartending or grants. Nevertheless Botschaft j|| takes over a few assignments other institutions would have to fulfill. Sll The infrastructure takes care of the social background._x000D_ The reunification, the result of squatting the WMF-Building, and its location in the east part of town, were certainly important for the foundation. The whole physical context influenced the events Botschaft organized. A situation which is changing at the moment. Projects which were bound to a certain time or euphoric start failed because the atmosphere changed._x000D_ The computer networks are now in a similar situation like the city was shortly after reunification. Something explodes into a vacuum. The webs are growing and free spaces are being created. Although at the moment the impression is spread that quick, swift action is necessary. Therefore, to squat ""spaces"" again...? The danger exists that the political connotation of these ""spaces"" will be neglected. We should be aware that what is changing is the form, not the content of the discussion._x000D_ Botschaft doesn't appear in public as a closed group, propagating a manifest. Ideas are taken up by members and further developed. Authorship is automatically being questioned, without becoming a central theme. The question: What will future practice look like? The pressure to make a statement about the art system is huge. It is annoying when projects don't function freely enough, although they are principally all right._x000D_ Projects with a more process like character such as i.e. ""Beirut/NY/Berlin"" or ""Museum for Future"" 07 stand beside events like ""Botschaft Praxis"" 08, a combination of three individual works or ""IG Farben"" 09 , a pragmatically political action. At the ""Beirut/NY/Berlin"" 10 project the ongoing character becomes clear. In the beginning two separate events were planned, one in Beirut and one in Berlin. However the realization was delayed. Out of that, developed an interest in observing the ""non public"" phases. A few projects consciously moved in the peripheral art area and use this place not as a springboard for the center but because of the quality of communication there, which isn't present in the center.- The option to work in a small group over 1 or 2 years on a certain theme without giving way to the pressure of the public, could be signified as a ""Strategy of Refusal"".-""Strategy of Refusal"" is too superficial,-It is a ""Strategy of Refusal"" because there is a ""Dictation of Production"", The latter means that results have to be delivered and in any case, continuously,-Today the term ""product"" is differently defined, Information itself is the product. That's why it is necessary to tie strategic alliances, to build up, in a short time, a functioning web where information can be positioned,-Although to justify certain themes, sometimes a change of velocity is useful to slow down in order to delay the moment of publishing. This also means to understand BOTSHAFT as a possible ""public space"".-It is very convenient to declare the heterogeneity of the group as a fundamental principle. To give the inside communication a priority means excluding other parts of the public which could be an asset for the process,-This has something to do with the fear of ""failure""-When the ""failing"" becomes and stays self-referential it is without doubt counter productive. If, on the other hand the public is integrated after a certain phase, then there exists the possibility that ""failure"" can release a public discourse._x000D_ _x000D_ Anmerkungen_x000D_ 01 In November 1990, the former headquarters of the WMF, a firm mainly manufacturing cutlery and kitchenware, became the spiritual starting point and place for the project ""Dromomania - cult and ritual of daily movement-"" Botschaft squatted the 4Th. floor of this house for the sake of working space room for events and initiated a project which operated on the intersection of architecture, city planning, art and citizens'initiatves._x000D_ 02 ""Richtig 92"" was a row of events dealing about the understanding of reality and in a broader sense about ""documentation"". Excerpt from the press info ""In traditional media, but also in disciplines like art or philosophy, under the heading ot such titles as ""The Disappearing of Reality"", there is a desperate creation of strategies to save ""reality"". Out of a helplessness confronting the complexity of the phenomenon, very often critic arises against the audio-visual-communication tools and the developing computer technology, which basically questions their use and meaning. By doing so one thing is overlooked. Man without a TV-set already had a problem with reality. The question: Who we are and what happens at the moment? is as old as mankind itself.""_x000D_ 03 ""Museum fur Geschichte"" (Museum of History) and ""Fishing for Documents"", two ""Richtig 92"" events, which took place one after the other, had a completely different audience although both events belonged together thematically, and had to be understood as a global statement. With ""Museum fur Geschichte"" six artists, for the duration of one week each, located a model-archiv. In the spotlight stood cooperation as a means to connect that what was presented and took place before with the actual exhibition. Each exhibition followed a model and took over from the previous exhibitions an excerpt, a souvenir, a fragment. With ""Fishing for Documents"" video and film makers were invited to do a row of seminars. On two weekends working methods in-between documentary and fictional movies were presented and discussed._x000D_ 04 Example: Row of exhibitions ""Dagegen-Dabei"" (Against it-in it) January 1995, Kunstverein Hamburg, shows production and strategy of art projects since 1969. Botschaft together with two other groups called ""Büro Bert"" and ""minimal club"" will work out a radio programme for 10 days. Temporarily the exhibition space will turn into an office, archive and broadcast studio._x000D_ 05 Since January 1993 Dogfilm (5 persons who are all founding members of Botschaft) continuously work for a political TV-magazine called ""Z"", once a month which is broadcasted all over Germany on the frequency of RTL. As part of the editing staff Dogfilm has the possibility to practically realize its vision of a reflexive, interdisciplinary videowork._x000D_ 06 1992/93 six ABM jobs (a project financed by the Berlin Senat for unemployed people) at Botschaftwere granted. An equipment pool was designed and the wages of 6 people were divided so that 10 people could work for Botschaft_x000D_ 07 In December 1993 the ""Museum for Future"" was installed for the first time in the Künstlerhaus Bethanien for the duration of a fortnight. Ideas about future were collected and communicated. The collected material, which was ordered in numerical organizers is at the moment being digitized in order to be accessible through Internet. The structure of the ""Museum for Future"" is in a state of ongoing process and at the same time subject of discussion._x000D_ 08 Three individual works, ""cip"", ""pacemaker"" and ""E-SMOG"", have been made and shown at BotschaftIn the Shedhalle in Zurich (may 94) these projects were for the first time under the heading of ""Botschaft Practice"" presented. ""Botschaft practice"" referred to the aspect of a community as a practical platform of exchange._x000D_ 09 By the example of ""IG Farben"" (During WW II the world greatest chemical industry, responsible for producing ""Zyklon B""), it becomes clear how. a supposedly forgotten sector of German history is confronting us today again with the national-socialistic past. The ""IG Farben"" shares seem to be a good deal for young brokers. The main issue of the project was therefore to concentrate on the actual situation of ""IG Farben"", who tries to reclaim buildings in the former east. The 53 real estate objects in Berlin were marked by posters, which gave information about the history of ""IG Farben"" and what will happen to the buildings in the near future. Simultaneously in the exhibition space of Botschaft, the action as a documentation was presented and at the opening a lecture was given by Hans Frankenthal, who is a member of the ""Auschwitz committee"" and a former forced laborer at ""IG Farben"" and over 40 years now actively doing resistance work against this company. At the same time a lot of articles appeared in various newspapers._x000D_ 10 ""Beirut/NY/Berlin"" is work in progress and has already gone through different phases of work and discussion. This was actually not expected when Jayce Salloum and Walid Raad, participants of ""Fishing for Documents"", came up with the idea of organizing something like an exchange. During the preparations it became clear that those who wanted to be involved only had access to little information and clichés. No wonder, cause Beirut is being described as ""playground of terror"", the media constantly spread anti-Arabic propaganda increasingly since the disappearing of the old enemy ""communism"". After almost two years of communication, misunderstandings, euphoria and skepticism, five members of Botschaft will fly to Beirut for a direct contact with the participants in Beirut._x000D_"

Espacio P,"Espacio P is a benchmark among alternative spaces that are self-organised by artists in Madrid. Launched and directed by the multimedia artist, Pedro Garhel (Tenerife, 1952-2005), it developed collaborative dynamics of research, training and production. It also implemented the use of shared resources and means of diffusion that remained practically unexplored at that time in Spain.Its hybrid structure was the result of opening up and merging different artistic concepts and fields as well as crossing over and beyond the traditional limits of the exhibition space, the stage and the laboratory for research and production. Its aim was to explore the edges between the visual, performance and sound arts, so that different practices and languages were linked, through the sharing of a single space with multiple functions. _x000D_ Moreover, its programme was inclusive and socially engaging: it was a place where artists created community and art was synonymous with life and with shared experiences and knowledge.Between 1981 and 1997, Espacio P organised all kinds of activities related to performance, photography, installations, visual poetry, postal art, film, video and experimental music, as well as electronic and virtual reality art, at a time when the majority of art galleries and museums were celebrating the resurgence of painting.The remarkable trajectory of the activities of Espacio P is related to several thematic hubs: do-it-yourself culture between fluxus and punk; action art and audiovisual language; the gender question; interventions in the public space; and the transition from the analog era to digital culture. Overall, it aimed to focus attention on artistic practices which were facing up to the challenges of the globalisation of culture, of production and of the markets. In addition, those practices tackled alternatives to the impact of media power by the construction of new spaces as well as individual and collective identities in a period of transition towards the post-industrial society. Space P is one of the pioneer initiatives of artistic self-management in Spain. Located in the center of Madrid between 1981 and 1997, he set up new training and production models, and introduced methods to manage resources and collaborations that have not been explored until then in this country._x000D_ Space P was one of the first Spanish alternative spaces, active between 1981 and 1997. The “P” led to “performance” and also “polival”. Throughout its trajectory it was also presented as “Performance Alternative Space”, “Polivalent Space”, “Art of Present”, “Audiovisual Art Centre”. It was an independent initiative of experimentation, a non-formal learning of extracademic arts, production and exhibition, as well as a place of experience and exchange of experience and knowledge, as well as a place of collective practice._x000D_Inhabited in an ancient sacrament of the St. Ana, the Aurcumánce, the Apricotios de las de las de Civicés de las de las de Civicés de las de las de las de las de las de l'artés de las de las de las de las de las de las de las de las de las de las de las de las de los de los de los de los de los de los de los de los de losación."

Rinomina,"In 2015, in collaboration with Markus Lichti, we created an exhibition space called Rinomina (in Italian renamed, re-named). We founded this place with the objective of giving shape to our own artistic practice here in Paris, but most of all, to give other artists the opportunity to create exhibitions there. The name ‘Rinomina’ comes from the Italian expression for renaming a file on a computer. It is a transitive verb {consists of ‘re’ and ‘name’} and means to name again, to rename or to change a name ; in particular, in the IT world, assign a file or document a different title from the previous one. The fascinating possibility of literally renaming everything is one of the main inspiration for this exhibition space.Rinomina conceives its programming and curatorial practice as strongly rooted in our own artistic activity. Since its creation, this space has exhibited many artists from the contemporary French and international scene, in a heterogeneous and dynamic program, such as: Felicia Atkinson, Louise Drulhe, Raphaël Bastide, Cécile Bicler, Eric Giraudet de Boudemange, Vanessa Dziuba, Martin Chramosta, Victoire Barbot, Jean-Philippe Breitin, Noemie Vulpian, Dominique Koch, Ambra Pittoni, Thomas Geiger, Claudia de La Torre Ana Navas and many others. Rinomina tries to act coherently in a flexible, conceptual and collaborative process, aiming to maintain a divergent perspective on what an exhibition space can be.About the founderDaniela Baldelli was born 1977 in Asmara, Eritrea.

MŰTŐ,"MŰTŐ was founded in 2016 in Budapest. In the past four years we organized over 37 exhibitions and more than 22 music performances, participated at two international art fairs for non-profit institutions (in Stockholm and Helsinki) and collaborated with artists, musicians and artist-run galleries from Eastern-Europe to the USA.As a DIY cultural initiative MŰTŐ is built on a constant dialogue across a collective of artists and curators. Our project is a community-run gallery and as such, the values of cooperation and openness are inherent in our structure. The existence of MŰTŐ is not only reliant on the team behind it but also on the support and participation of the local alternative music and art scene. Even before the pandemic, Hungarian cultural politics had been characterised by the refusal of critical contemporary thought and the systematic exclusion of independent, self-organised cultural initiatives from the state-run infrastructure and its funding bodies. The post-pandemic economic crisis only made those tendencies even more apparent, while it also verified the increasingly important role that DIY cultural initiatives have in the local context of contemporary culture and its communities and future possibilities.We’ve been building an international web of long-term collaborative partners whose work is reliant on mutual interest, reciprocal dialogue and creative solutions. In our 2019’s open call we received more than 100 proposals from Hungary and abroad. The half of our yearly program is based on international artist’s proposals. As a joint program we invite local and regional musicians or performance artists. This has grown into organising two international events funded by different grants. An international performance festival – funded by Summa Artium, called Sandbox Festival, where real time efforts collide with virtual ones, where the traditions of performance, happening and action expand and bring about an event where the consumption of art becomes a shared experience. We realize this event with past collaborators and new partners in Spring 2021, in Budapest. In February 2020 we launched the Alterum – Artist-run network in the CEE region, Visegrad Fund project that focuses on non-profit, artist-run galleries as increasingly important platforms in the context of contemporary Central and Eastern Europe."

After 2009, I organized a large demonstration at the Royal School of Art School in Versailles, I organized a large demonstration at the King's Palace, with the Latage of Art and Botanique's Association. The idea was to attend to the 17th-year-terms. I was to the 17th-year-old-old-old-old-old-olds-olds. In our exchanges with different actors like Séverine Marguin's research on the projects of Paris and Berlin or the Brazilian exhibition commissioner Fabiana de Moraes on the art-runs of Brazil (...) I was always on the tapes of the artist-run's work; it's like since this time and to this day I've been waiting for someone to write the story."
monopôle,"Sanaquile is an independent artistic space founded in 2021 by the technical pool association, an association composed of 10 artists, authors, plasticians, and designers. Its project consists of investing in the territory and cultural scene of Lyons - often deserted by students at school - as well as maintaining, enduring and expanding the community of artists present in Lyon with exhibitions, events and encounters."
Les 2 portes,"The Association The 2 Ports was created from the meeting of three artists Caroline Pageaud, Gwilherm Curbet and Audrey Devaud in the workshop of the Casarne Vauban city of Besançon._x000D_ The project of the gallery then took place in a dynamic and independent place in the heart of the Rivotte district in Besançon, rich of its artists and artists already installed and the City of Arts in proximity (FRAC and Conservatoire)._x000D_ The 2 Ports are in front of any place of work but also has an area dedicated to gravity (the size of dollage, xylography, lynography and lithography) for the public practices of the art industry."

TILDE,"Tilde is a para-institution for contemporary art and research, presenting projects in several forms and places, both in its space in Amsterdam and collaborating with other spaces in The Netherlands and abroad. While organizing specific projects and off-site events, carefully unfolding experimental practices in close collaboration with artists, thinkers, writers, researchers, and the community, Tilde aims to create connections between local and international, young and older practitioners. Tilde promotes interdisciplinary dialogues and encourages involvement with other non–profit spaces, as well as institutional and educational systems nationally and internationally.It is run by artist and curator Diego Diez, who was previously co-directing the Amsterdam project space Plat- (2017-2019) and organizing group exhibitions such as Lockers (2017, 2019). After co-directing Plat- for two years I decided to work on my own and I founded Tilde as a some sort of next step of Plat-. Tilde aims to be able to reshape itself for the needs of the artists it works with, not being tied to a set of walls and lights, but with the possibility to offer to the artists what they might be looking for at that time of their careers.Since its start in October 2019 Tilde has created a line where works by stablished artists such as Francisco de Goya y Lucientes, Laure Prouvost or Moyra Davey are shown next to younger artists such as Vincent Verhoef, Maria Nolla Mateos or Sara Milio, a.o.. Another characteristic of the space is the intention to put in context the work of artists working in Amsterdam with international artist, allowing both parts to discover different contexts within a similar approach to art making. Mostly presenting duo or small group shows the aim of the project is to offer a space for conversation between different generations and points of departure, with a public presentation understood as an exhibition but with an important part behind the scenes, where the artists discuss and share their knowledge and methodologies. Relationships make up an important part of the shows at Tilde, especially as it is based in my apartment: the artists usually stay there for a week for set up. This means the conversations about the show happen more informally, like when cooking breakfast. While theoretically grounded, my approach to curating is based more on direct relationships with artists, proximity, friendship and the processual development of exhibitions, rather than working on a thematic base._x000D_"
Corridor Project Space,"As Corridor Project Space we are an independent and interdisciplinary contemporary art initiative in Amsterdam. We believe in the importance of experimental art practices which focus on the creation of new content that are off grid from the institutional and commercial circles. Therefore we initiate projects where artists, writers, curators, activists and theorists can meet. Together they can think and work on projects with the aim to blend their practices and cultures. We want to make it possible for artists to work together creating new projects and expanding towards potential encounters. Our belief is that it is necessary to give the artists, collaborators and visitors a safe space where they can express their own concerns, expectations and hopes._x000D_ What identifies our initiative is that together with creating space for duo and collective art exhibitions; we also organize dinners, talks, screenings and lectures that make space for conversation and new interactions. The social aspect of our events make it possible for an international working platform where artists, writers and mediators from Dutch arts and international hubs get to know each other._x000D_ Inclusivity is one of our main focusing points. We do so by including in our collaborations art professionals from all nations, genders, abilities and career stages. Not only do we include a variety of collaborators, but we also convey an openness where artists and curators may propose to make use of the space by their own initiation. Our team itself is composed internationally and we have special connection with artists based in Turkey. This inclusivity goes beyond the artists and professionals we work with, and applies also to the audience and visitors we want to attract. In our public communications, we convey a receptive language. We intentionally seek a variety of artistic perspectives and critical approaches. We create an annual program and draw curatorial directions while leaving the development of each exhibition experimental and flexible. During the making of each project we create a smooth dialogue between the collaborators and support them as much as we can practically, intellectually, economically and emotionally."

Red Cactus Art Studio,"The Red Cactus Art Studio is a workshop created in August 2020 at the initiative of Helène Battaini, an artist. The site of creation and exhibition is constantly evolving reflecting the artistic research of Helène Battaini. Born of four walls forgotten in the historical center, the Red Cactus Art Studio now includes an exhibition space, a library, musical instruments, plastic material available for every Friday when the gallery is open to the public. Helène Battaini presents its work throughout the year and sometimes organises exhibitions of other artists and events of short and regular events in order to propose a variety of cultural works outside the city. The structure I created is a workshop called the Red Cactus Art Studio (2 red carpets, Montpellier). I wanted to make it a place called ""social art"". From my point of view it answers questions of current society, i.e. preserving the independence of its own culture and its accessibility to its own heritage. One day per week the place is open to the public and participatory. The material is free of use to anyone in communication. I have materials for the practice of plastics and also musical instruments and books. There is no need for writing, paying or being able to sit on my own things. I have no need to be able to use them as part of my body to make them. My space can be seen as a work in the sense that it reflects a thought developed for progress (from society) and that it goes through an aesthetic research. However, it is constantly evolving so it may be an installation or performance rather than a final work. Hélène Battaini Red Cactus Art Studio, in Montpellier @redcatusartstudio"
44 Gassendi,"The area is designed to be transformed from 3 to 4 times a year into an exhibition area, which is suitable for guests.When it was created, the 360 agency dreamed of being an open space on its environment, contributing to the vitality of the places and ideas.The offices located at 44 Gassendi Street included this will: a polymorphic space, which welcomes the activities of the district, and exhibits artists working on the urban, territories, lifestyles."
IN OUT,"In OUT it is a place of dissemination with the location, equipment and communication. In OUT is a place for artists, designed to offer visibility to works, various contemporary disciplines, arts living in plastic arts. To promote sharing, knowledge, exchanges and artistic reflections, meeting times are organized between artists, professionals, and the public. These public meetings allow us to question projects, cross-views, experiences, and research. It is a place of learning, experimentation for the creation turned towards and on the outside, with the aim of trying other local and national cultural structures."
NICC,"NICC [New International Cultural Center] creates spaces for interaction between visual artists, institutions and society, with specific attention to the position of the visual artist, on a local, regional and international level.NICC plays an active role in the support and self-realisation of the professional visual artist. Its aim is to function as first contact and representatives for visual artists, striving for a qualitative social framework enabling the visual artist to develop his/her practice in a professional and autonomous way. The International Cultural Centre (ICC) in Antwerp was founded in 1970 and was the first public institution for contemporary art in Flanders. During the 70s and early 80s the organization contributed significantly to the stimulation and dissemination of the Belgian and international avant-garde. The shutting down of the ICC (1998) resulted in the occupation of its building by the group ‘Hit&Run’, this resulted in the establishment of the NICC.From 1998 to 2002 the NICC was run by artists such as Luc Tuymans, Guillaume Bijl and Danny Devos. In addition to an exhibition program, the NICC was committed to the advocacy of visual artists. From 2002 to 2006, the NICC focused on social policy. Three new non-profit organisations were founded by people who had previously worked at the NICC: Extra City, Objectif Exhibitions, and Air Antwerpen. Indirectly, the BAM and Kunstenloket support centres were also established at the request of the NICC.From 2008 to 2012 the NICC was managed by a new group of artists. Despite the limited budget , a rich, public program was developed in Antwerp’s Tulpstraat.In 2013, the NICC moved to Brussels to further develop its supra-local operations and influence. From this location, the NICC Vitrine, a diverse program of artist talks and vitrine presentations was realized with local and international artists such as Dennis Tyfus, Sammy Baloji, Shana Moulton, etc. Ahead of the 20 year anniversary, NICC returned to Antwerp South in 2017. In 2018, NICC presented two large-scale projects: OPEN STUDIO’S 2018 and 20 YEARS NICC (view the powerpoint of 20 YEARS NICC here). With OPEN STUDIO’S NICC wanted to focus attention on the need for affordable workspaces and cultural usage of vacant space, from this grew the initiative to bring all Flemish studio organizations together in the UFO platform. In the summer of 2019, NICC organized a debate in collaboration with De Nor on the sense and nonsense of the artist status for visual artists. At the M HKA, NICC reacted to the policy plan and announced cuts in a visual way with Without Artists No Art (2020). In the summer of 2020, NICC became part of the Artists Coalition. During the period of 2018-2021, the NICC also maintained a constant conversation with advice and critiques to the Cabinet and the administration of the Department of Culture. The NICC also spent 1.5 years as a partner establishing the correct pay framework “right is right” and the federal holistic reform of the socioeconomic status of the Artist, Working in the Arts (WITA).Anno 2023, the NICC continues to question the realization of the above-mentioned trajectories in daily practice and wants to know how we can continue to stimulate dialogue between governments, support structures and interest groups in order to strengthen the position of the artist in a sustainable way."

Fashion Moda,"Fashion 时髦 Moda МОДА, whose name comes from “fashion” in English, Chinese, Spanish and Russian, colloquially referred to as Fashion Moda, started as a cultural concept guided by the idea that art can be made by anyone, anywhere. Fashion Moda was an art space located in the South Bronx, New York founded by Stefan Eins in 1978. As a museum of science, art, invention, technology, and fantasy, it was an alternative art space that combined aspects of a community arts center and a worldwide progressive arts organization until its closing in 1993. Fashion Moda was an art space founded by Stephen Eins in 1978 after closing his previous project, the 3 Mercer Store. Eins was soon joined by artist, poet and musician, Joe Lewis and William Scott, a nineteen year-old from the neighborhood as co-directors. The gallery was located in the South Bronx, outside the traditional art gallery district which was emerging in Soho at the time. Despite this, Fashion Moda quickly became a strong voice in the New York art world during the late 1970s and the 1980s. The venue provided a platform for exchanges between downtown Manhattan artists, graffiti writers, and Bronx residents. The space encouraged the production of creative art, unhampered by the contemporary art market and academic art training. As such, it was a center for many downtown and local South Bronx artists, writers, and performance artists to workshop their ideas and first display their works. Fashion Moda received funding annually with grants from the National Endowment for the Art and the New York State Council of the Arts. In addition to art shows, the space held auctions, performances, seminars, and other events.With the South Bronx location, Fashion Moda was closely tied to the global emergence of Hip Hop. Wild Style, a documentary by Charlie Ahearn on the manifesto of hip hop used Fashion Moda as studio and subject. Exhibitions and events were usually accompanied by musical performances including those from talents ranging from Afrika Bambaataa or Rammellzee to jazz musicians such as Jerome Cooper and Rasul Siddik.Fashion Moda played a major role in legitimizing graffiti as an art form by presenting one of the first graffiti gallery exhibitions in October 1980. Curated by the 19-year-old John “Crash” Matos, the Graffiti Art Success for America show featured artists such as Fab 5 Freddy, Futura 2000, Lady Pink, and Lee Quinones. It was one of the first spaces to allow artists to paint directly on the walls and facade of the gallery. This influential show opened up new possibilities for the art form by allowing street artists to connect with critics, collectors, and curators.Fashion Moda introduced and exhibited a wide range of artists. Fashion Moda facilitated many exhibitions and collaborations between artists. John Ahearn and Rigoberto Torres utilized Fashion Moda as a meeting place and collaborated to create life casts of Bronx locals which were exhibited in the South Bronx Hall of Fame show.In addition to highlighting new talent, Fashion Moda was a major force in establishing new venues. In 1980, Fashion Moda collaborated with the downtown progressive artist collective, Colab (Collaborative Projects Inc.), on The Times Square Show, which introduced uptown graffiti-related art to the downtown art and punk scenes. Set up in an abandoned massage parlor in Manhattan's Times Square, the Times Square Show included a mock store, performances, graffiti, a punching bag, peep shows, protest actions, and parodic manifestos. The goal of this shows was to legitimize an art form outside of the traditional art scene and exhibit it to the mainstream art world.In 1982, Fashion Moda was invited to participate in Documenta 7, a quinquennial contemporary art exhibition held in Kassel, Germany. At this event, a store was set up like the Time Square Show where shirts, prints, and novelty items from participating artists could be bought. A video lounge was also set up so that artists’ videos could be watched and purchased. The exhibition reflected the idea of art as a commodity and its power to spread social messages.Joe Lewis left Fashion Moda in 1982, but it continued a program of exhibitions until its official closing in 1993."

Pamela Artist-run Space,"Pamela is not a collective, Pamela is an artistic cooperative. Pamela is active in combining material and intangible resources to the service of the artists of its territory and beyond. Pamela is a tool for continuous use that thinks of the artist's situation today to invent tomorrow's practices. Pamela is a platform to meet between the different actors and public of the art world. Pamela is a counterpoint. Pamela is a field of aesthetic, political, economic and social experimentation to question more than it can and must be done today. Pamela is a point on the map. Since the beginning of Pamela's creation, we are aware of the fact that the collective term, often attributed to this type of project, is not used to our subject to prefer the cooperative. This term seems to be more appropriate to define what we like, namely the combination of material and material resources in a project for its members and artists with which we choose to work on the principle of the art-run space as a place of thought and by artists. It seems important to us in a middle of the art that remains very vertical in its functions to create a place that we like. This term appears to be more appropriate to define what we like, namely, that is the common set of material and material resources in a project for its members. This is the setting up of a common set of material and material resources for its members. This is the setting of the structure of its members and its artists with which we choose to work. It is the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure of the structure. We do not think that Pamela is a work to be spoken by itself but may be considered to be a work under the conditions and contexts where she operates her actions. As mentioned above, Pamela does not think of herself as a collective but as a tool for the service of artists who create it outside of any plastic community. Pamela is a variable geometry tool whose uses are re-invented according to the proposals of the artists who invest it. If Pamela does not think of it as a work as a priority, it is possible that in the future a first period of activity could work at this moment, at the same time, at the same time, at the same time, and at the same time perform the work of the artist."
Pauline Perplexe,"Pauline Perplexe is the name of an old family home located in Arcuel, managed by artists and converted into an independent place of artistic production and exhibition since 2015.The dynamics of this place and its construction in daily life feed tropicals. The space is divided into two levels in workshops and exhibition rooms and combines without exception, according to the requirements and uniqueness of each project. The program takes multiple forms: concerts, readings, projections, and other initiatives. By inviting artists from this space as a platform, Pauline Perplexe wants to promote the experimentation of possible designs and designs with respect to each project."

ARTISTS SPACE,"Founded in 1972 in downtown Manhattan, Artists Space fosters the artistic and cultural life of New York City as a primary venue for artists' work in all forms. An affinity with emerging ideas and artists is central to our institution, as is attentiveness to the social and intellectual concerns which actively inform artistic practice. We strive for exemplary conditions in which to produce, experience, and understand art, to be a locus of critical discourse and education, and to advocate for the capacity of artistic work to significantly define and reflect our understanding of ourselves. Artists Space was founded in 1972 by arts administrator Trudie Grace and critic Irving Sandler as a pilot project for the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA), with the goal of assisting and presenting emerging and unaffiliated artists. Artists Space quickly became a leading organization in the downtown alternative arts scene in New York, which also included burgeoning institutions such as the 112 Workshop (later renamed White Columns), and the Institute for Art and Urban Resources (which became P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center)._x000D_ During its first years, all of Artists Space's exhibitions were organized by artists presenting the work of other artists. Other early efforts to engage and help artists included the Emergency Materials Fund, which assisted artists with the presentation of their work at an established nonprofit venue, and the Independent Exhibitions Program, which supported the needs of artists who were involved in the production and presentation of work outside the context of an existing institutional structure. Through the decades, Artists Space has adapted to the shifting needs and concerns of artists and audiences in and outside of New York._x000D_ Artists Space has been the site of provocative discussion and experimentation within contemporary artistic debate, from the postmodern image (Douglas Crimp’s Pictures, 1977) to identity politics (Adrian Piper’s It’s Just Art, 1981), to institutional critique (Michael Asher’s Untitled, 1988) to the AIDS Crisis (Nan Goldin’s Witnesses: Against our Vanishing, 1989), and Artists Space has introduced countless artists to a wider public, amongst them Joan Jonas, Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons, Sherrie Levine, Louise Lawler, Laurie Anderson, Barbara Bloom, John Miller, John Baldessari, Jack Smith, Andrea Fraser, Haim Steinbach, Tim Rollins, Lyle Ashton Harris, Ashley Bickerton, Peter Halley, Lari Pittman, Group Material, Stuart Sherman, Barbara Kruger, Laurie Simmons, Anthony McCall, Fred Wilson, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Mike Kelley, Judith Barry, Michael Smith, Robert Longo, Jenny Holzer, Pope.L, Hito Steyerl, Danh Vo, and Cameron Rowland."

ART HOUSE,"Art House has been conceived as a meeting point where the house, a place where people can share intimate time and space, meets the experience of art, as a human need to shape and to articulate personal experiences.This place aims to be a center where the family will open up to the community of this small town allowing it to grow from the contributions and interactions with the international art world; permitting for an enriching exchange emphasizing and giving value to a close and friendly relationship between participants.To us, art is not a decorative ornament on the walls of a luxurious villa or in corridors of power, but a space where creative visions and a vital thinking take form. Art House is not a temple where art is venerated, but a laboratory where art is always questioned. This is why we hope this place will be transformed into an art think tank where culture is not a mere accumulation of books, but a vital human experience."
Franklin Furnace,"Franklin Furnace was founded in 1976 to serve artists who chose publishing as a primary,""democratic"" artistic medium, and were not being supported by existing artistic organizations. From its inception, Franklin Furnace's energies have been focused on three aspects of ""time-based"" programming: A collection of artists' books; a performance art program for emerging artists; and exhibitions of time-based arts, both site-specific works by contemporary artists, and historical and contemporary exhibitions of artists' books and other time-based, ephemeral arts._x000D_ During the last 20 years, Franklin Furnace has gained a national and international reputation for identifying artists who have changed the terms by which contemporary art is discussed; mounting scholarly exhibitions that have embodied the history of 20th Century avant-garde activity; and standing up for the right of the artists to freedom of expression as guaranteed under the First Amendment._x000D_ Among those artists who were given the opportunity to mount their first New York shows at Franklin Furnace are Ida Applebroog, Guillaume Bijl, Dara Birnbaum, Willie Cole, James Coleman, Jenny Holzer, Tehching Hsieh, Barbara Kruger, Matt Mullican, Shirin Neshat, and Krysztof Wodiczko; while among the performers who got their start here are Eric Bogosian, David Cale, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, Karen Finley, Robbie McCauley, Theodora Skipitares, Michael Smith, and Paul Zaloom. Additionally, Franklin Furnace's performance art program has enabled more established artists like Vito Acconci, Laurie Anderson, Jennifer Bartlett, Lee Breuer, Richard Foreman, Joan Jonas, William Pope.L, and William Wegman to experiment in ways that would be inappropriate for mainstream venues that attract larger audiences. Franklin Furnace's exhibition program has included many historically notable exhibitions of time-based art of an ephemeral nature -- exhibitions on Cubist books and prints, for example, on Fluxus, or Russian Samizdat art -- critically celebrated exhibitions that have contributed to art historical scholarship._x000D_ In November, 1993, Franklin Furnace and the Museum of Modern Art signed an agreement to merge Franklin Furnace's collection of artists' books published internationally after 1960, the largest repository of this nature in the United States, with that of MOMA, forming a resource of unparalleled value: the Museum of Modern Art/Franklin Furnace/Artist Book Collection._x000D_ Franklin Furnace's basement performance space was closed by the New York City Fire Department in 1990 in response to an anonymous caller, and since that time Franklin Furnace has been presenting performance art to new audiences throughout the City by developing strategic partnerships with institutions great and small, from The New School for Social Research to Dixon Place. From 1998-1999, Franklin Furnace presented new temporal art to worldwide audiences through a collaboration with Pseudo Programs, Inc._x000D_ In 1996-1997, during its 20th anniversary season, Franklin Furnace reinvented itself as a virtual institution, not identified with its real estate but rather with its resources, made accessible by electronic and other means. No longer providing a venue for performance art projects, the organization concentrated on awarding grants to artists via the Franklin Furnace Fund for Performance Art and the Future of the Present programs. In the spring of 2008, Franklin Furnace combined the Franklin Furnace Fund for Performance Art and the Future of the Present programs into one, entitled the Franklin Furnace Fund._x000D_ In December, 2014, Franklin Furnace relocated to Pratt Institutes Brooklyn campus under an organization-in-residence agreement. The decision to ""nest"" within Pratt Institute coincided with their announcement of a new Master of Fine Arts program in performance and performance studies."
The Mothership,"The Mothership education program organizes its pedagogy around 5 steps of color research. In the first step, we identify the plants, in the second we forage or source the plants, in the third we extract the dyes, in the fourth, we transform the dye into various media, and in the final step, we apply the dyes to textiles and other materials._x000D_ These five steps are circular, it is a process that repeats itself. Students can intervene in a single step, or go through the entire process, as relevant to their needs and practice. Classes and workshops focused on natural dyeing and other textile techniques, sustainable planting, and land management, are organized and facilitated by the Mothership as an effort to bring awareness to the need to preserve traditional practices and encourage artists to explore these techniques and materials in their work. This educational programming is offered in different formats and taught by local and international expert artists throughout the year. Scholarships to local students will be available. The Mothership is an artist-led project by Yto Barrada creating space and time for research, artistic exploration, and retreat, inspired by natural dyes. Based in Tangier, the project is envisioned as an ‘eco-campus’ for growing, making, and learning natural dyes and indigenous traditions, and a place for experimental collective artistic practice through art residencies and workshops. The Mothership will be “a place to conjure pan-African eco-feminist practices into being”. Founder Yto Barrada grew up in her parent's home adjacent to the wilder lands which now house the Mothership; in 2003 she moved with her family to live in the Gardener’s House, and now share her time between New York and Tangier. Since then a growing circle of collaborators and friends have joined her efforts to help envision and manifest The Mothership’s Natural Dye Garden, residency and education programs."
The Why Not Gallery ,"The Why Not Gallery is a Tbilisi-based contemporary art gallery dedicated to supporting and promoting young Georgian artists. Founded in 2018, by friends and fellow colleagues artist Gvantsa Jishkariani and curator Ellen Kapanadze, the gallery was first conceived as an experimental not-for-profit project space that chose a vitrine in an underground passageway as its first location.Dedicated to challenging the accepted norms and conventions, the gallery moved to its first permanent space in 2020 and started working on larger exhibitions program. Soon it established itself on the Georgian arts scene as the main destination for discovering exciting emmerging Georgian artists. Providing full support, the gallery often organizes the artists’ first solo shows and acts as an instigator to their careers.The gallery is dedicated to providing a platform for all sorts of experimentations and trials. In 2022 launched a new space, dedicated to more experimental projects that hosts a variety of creatives not limited to the field of visual arts.Apart from the exhibition-making, the gallery also runs the project The Why Not Gift Shop, where it collaborates with artists and produces limited edition items. The collaborations translate the artists’ practices in unexpected ways and result in affordable, yet unique finds. The project also provides additional source of income for the young artists and contributes to developing the scene."
019,"Since 2013 it is used for exhibitions, lectures, workshops, and (unt 2018) concerts.The layout and appearance of the project space are constantly evolving. Architectural interventions are regularly changing the access, walking and sighting a context that calls the different users of the area to interact.The project space is also a platform for many others. Organizations, students and schools regularly organize their activities, from end-of-years to private events. 019 was never going to remain the only place we worked in. From the start, it’s been a laboratory that swings us into unknown directions, constantly sharpening our sense of improvisation and reinvention on the spot. For three years, from 2013 onwards, we made that old welding factory at Dok Noord in Ghent (Belgium) the focal point of our activities. People even started to identify the entirety of our collective, Smoke & Dust, with what was basically only the name of its nineteenth project. We became 019. The whole project turned us upside down. But in doing so, we became aware as well. We understood that the act of occupying and taking possession of the site was not the goal of our work at all. From the inside out, starting with a wooden construction in its interior and up to the billboard at an outside wall and a series of flagpoles on the roof, we gradually developed the place into an assembly of undergrounds for public and artistic encounter, an emerging space for collaboration that was grounded on the premise that all media at our disposal were common grounds to be rediscovered. That is when the work began. That is when things began to move, for real. That is when we realized—artists, architects, designers and the like—we had all turned into scenographers, regardless of our discipline: co-authors of a scene that was constructed out of margins and constraints, participants in a game of give and take that we endlessly play around a display we like to recycle. In the end, that’s how 019, our handling of its space through appropriation and dispossession, became the site of a moving practice, a collaborative way of working ready to be moved, reproduced and reinvented elsewhere.

Galerie huit,"Galerie Huit was an art collective and gallery established by American artists in Paris in 1950. During the mid-twentieth century American artists traveled and lived in Paris to study and make art. Many of the male American artists were able to finance excursions to France because of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (the G.I. Bill). The city provided access to modern art as well as African art. Led by Haywood Rivers, American artists in Paris at that time united to create a cooperative gallery space to show their work.The Galerie Huit was located at 8, rue St. Julien le Pauvre. It existed from 1950 through 1954 according to a catalogue for the Reina Sofia Museum, other sources state that exhibitions were held from 1950 through 1952._x000D_ In 2002 the Studio 18 Gallery in New York City held an exhibition entitled Galerie Huit: American Artists in Paris 1950-1952 featuring Galerie Huit artists. In 2018 the Reina Sofia Museum in Madrid, Spain held an exhibition entitled Lost, Loose and Loved: Foreign Artists in Paris 1944-1968 that featured several of the Galerie Huit artists. Artists associated with the gallery include:_x000D_ Oscar Chelimsky [fr], Carmen D'Avino, Sam Francis, Sidney Geist, Simon Hantaï, Al Held, Raymond Hendler, Shirley Jaffe, Herbert Katzman, Paul F. Keene Jr., Jonah Kinigstein, Jules Olitski, George Earl Ortman, Marianna Pineda, Reginald Pollack, Haywood Rivers, Shinkichi Tajiri, Harold Tovish, Hugh Weiss [fr]"
La Cédille qui sourit.,"The Cédille carried materials from a variety of artists associated with Fluxus, including books from Dick Higgins’s Something Else Press as well as interactive multiples published by Daniel Spoerri’s MAT Editions and the Fluxus imprint, organized by George Maciunas. However, none of Brecht and Filliou’s works initiated there seemed to come to fruition; or, their material structure emphasized the possibility of endless reconfiguration. The Cédille’s haphazard, almost anti-retail display made its wares indistinguishable from the surrounding works-in-progress, an appropriate set-up for the sale of editions whose openness to change and alteration belonged to a nonconventional trajectory of artistic objecthood indebted to the readymades of Duchamp and the indeterminate compositions of John Cage. More like an atelier than white cube gallery, the Cédille was an extrapolation of the Fluxus model of the artwork-in-flux into an artist-run economy of production, distribution, and exchange that would, to borrow language from Maciunas’s 1963 manifesto, “promote a revolutionary flood and tide in art.”_x000D_ Given recent economic and political events, I am now encouraged to think of the transformations on the art object enacted by various Fluxus practices in terms of aderegulation of the art object, for that very term first came into use in the early 1960s in relation to emerging federal policy changes to the rail and truck transportation industries. These historical facts seem fitting, for what I am about to narrate is a story of the deregulation not only of the art object but also of its movement through certain art networks, motivated by artists’ frustration and disgust at networks’ paradoxical tendency to consolidate power._x000D_ The Cédille was a shop that kept no regular hours and had no tidy, reliable stock of merchandise. Still, it subsisted until 1968, when in March, Brecht and Filliou realized they could no longer afford to pay rent. By October, they had defaulted on a contract that should have carried the project into 1974. And thus we must admit that the Cédille, if indeed it was meant to function as a store, failed as a commercial venture. In 1962, Filliou realized The Legitime gallery, a travel and miniature personal gallery, which is contained in a castle. Filliou is presenting its creations or those of other artists (1962)._x000D_ Installed in Villafranche-sur-Mer, Robert Filliou opens in 1965 with Georges Brech: The Cédille that smiles, a non-boutique designed as an international centre of permanent creation. Extrait du très bon article de Natilee HarrenLa cédille qui ne finit pas: Robert Filliou, George Brecht, and Fluxus in Villefranche (deregulation version)_x000D_ Intégralité : http://www.artandeducation.net/paper/la-cedille-qui-ne-finit-pas-robert-filliou-george-brecht-and-fluxus-in-villefranche/_x000D_ In the summer of 1965, George Brecht and Robert Filliou, with the support of their partners Donna and Marianne, opened a shop at 12 rue de May in Villefranche-sur-Mer, a seaside village just east of Nice, France. The space, 36 meters square, with a canary yellow awning and chalkboard sign in the window, was called La Cédille Qui Sourit, or “The Cedilla That Smiles.” Conceived first as an English bookshop “under the sign of humor,” it was actually, as Filliou has recounted, “a sort of workshop and of shop, of nonshop would we say now, for we were never commercially registered, and the Cédille was always shut, opening only upon request of visitors to our homes.”_x000D_ The artists, both associated with the international, neo-avant-garde Fluxus collective, called their shop a “Center of Permanent Creation,” for they were continually producing research, letters, jokes, puzzles, games, recipes, poems, drawings, and events. Yet there were few unannounced visitors to the Cédille, or at least ones who were successful in visiting, since the shop did not have a telephone and Brecht and Filliou seemed not to spend much time there. The artists presided more often at one of the nearby cafés, devising more of the visual gags they called “One Minute Scenarios,” “dis-inventing” objects, adding to their “Anthology of Misunderstandings,” or talking with their friends Alfred the bricklayer, Antoine the fisherman, Fernand the plumber, or anyone else who happened to drop by._x000D_"
Faux Mouvement,"Since 1986 Faux Movement has developed an editorial policy by publishing contemporary art works: 16 titles in the catalogue in 2000. Since 1992, Faux Movement has been engaged with the Director of the Nancy-Mitz Academy and the LRAC Lorraine in an action to raise awareness of the school audience to contemporary creation. The work is aimed at discovering contemporary art and educating viewers through the approach of artistic practices (exhibited visits to exhibitions, plastic arts workshops) FAUX MOUVEMENT is a contemporary art structure, created in Metz in 1983. Working at the very place of exhibition, she started and organized numerous exhibitions in Düsseldorf (Kassemette KD2), Turin (Ucronia), Strasbourg (Liz Bachhuber), Paris... in various institutional, private or alternative locations. In 1992, Faux Movement opens a permanent exhibition space on the site of the Regional Directorate for Cultural Affairs of Lorraine, 8th place of House in Metz, focusing more on its action on Metz and Lorraine. Each project has six exhibitions per year. Each project is an original project designed specifically for the purposes of this space which is used as part of the project. In 1992, a large exhibition on art in Europe and the United States gathering fifty artists during this period was proposed to the public under the title ""The End of the World."" In 1996, at the exhibition of Sarikis Deux Zones, Faux Movement departed from the Regional Department of Culture in 1997, there was a retrospective exhibition on the art of 80th century in Europe and the United States."

PeepSpace,"I'm not sure I fully understand this question but I'll try to answer. I felt a need, had to assume others did too. That assumption proved true as artists upon artists have been a part. We're idealistic in our approach. We idealistically created a hub for culture, we idealistically invite artists to submit work, we have faith in the power of art and sharing it.There's simply infinite amounts of art being created and limited space for sharing it. So as long as there are humans making work, there is a need for exhibition spaces. And so a valuable tool for PeepSpace is the open call. We're constantly introduced to incredible artists who we wouldn't otherwise know this way. Sure. I feel differently about it than I do about my own personal visual art making but it is certainly a creative process. We built a thing, we bring others into the thing to experience it, it communicates our perspectives along with the artists we are showing. Just like another work of art, we digested and reconfigured previous ideas along with some possibly new thinking, and created a new item.

Kurt-forever,"If I have been active within the 6B team, during the first three years of its creation, this commitment has been revolutionized. Also, the short-term collective that I am co-founder is currently in the sleep - I have continued the commission and criticism in the past years. So I deliver a retroactive status, and this distance urges me to a less convincing approach, maybe a more generic about the concept of the artist's appearance. The 6b is really an artist, but it has never been, in fact, admirably, these were not known. This space, however, is ""placed"" to create. In a run-of-the-art culture, there is no place. This place that wanted to be ideally assembled all the others (atlier, space of exposure, criticism, conference, publication, sale...) the quarries of the least, but the englober, allowed a disseminating of the practices - between the theory and practice. In a run-of-the-art artist, the confusion of the places that are not of itself - or of the other. It is the sense of the product of the collection. The symbolic references are always asked by the closets, which are used to make them."
Palais des paris,"The context of art in Japan is different from the European context to have a much weaker field of knowledge of art and a more dynamic internal art market. Since then, institutions do not have the first role in establishing the definition of art and performing aesthetic judgment. The museums do not really have autonomy and exhibitions are mostly the result of private projects of the world's media or sometimes local politics. Japanese artists are used to pay for the existence of public. For contemporary art artists, the recommended strategy is to be recognized as a national artist who is not a nationalist. We do not think that the space of the ""Palais des Paris"" is a work. Our aim was to produce an articulation between the design of an artist producing an object and a local Japanese audience on the one hand. This art is a work of dialogue with the artist, contextualization and translation to the public in order to reach an understanding without interest. If we can consider our work as a ""work"", then it results in less space than the art of the language. The film from a residency can then also be considered as ""work"", it is by means of an image-text article based on this type of media."
GLASSBOX-NORD,"In history, Glasbox was conceived to respond to a particular need, that of the distribution of artists to the beautiful art of Paris. These artists are looking for spaces to show their work which are neither institutions nor commercial spaces, they do not want to be emancipated but also because these spaces are difficult to access new practices, without great visibility. Glassbox's programming remains in this interview, allowing great freedom of programming and choice of choice, creating an alternative to art centres or other structures that are more impermissible to search, to the wrong way, to the wrong way, or to put it to the wrong place. I do not think that space or function can be considered as a work, in the sense that its vocation is to welcome or make it germinate again. It is not only an empty box in which we would have something without any impact on this thing but a little like a machine, composed of places, tools, people who pass it, which affects the work that is placed in it. However, I think that in our practice in this space, methods can be similar to those of artists during creation: experimenting with formats, looking at things done and analysing them, modifying them in one sense or another by using them in one way or another by using them."
